% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The Minimum Degree Spanning Tree (MDST) problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that seeks to find a spanning tree of a given undirected graph with the minimum possible maximum degree. The MDST problem has significant implications in various fields, such as network design \cite{network}, telecommunications \cite{telecom}, and computational biology \cite{bio}. Despite its importance, the MDST problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{NP}, making it computationally expensive to solve using classical algorithms. In recent years, the advent of quantum computing has opened new possibilities for tackling complex optimization problems, promising significant speedups over classical methods.

One of the most prominent quantum algorithms is Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover}, which provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for unstructured problems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solving the MDST problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our approach constructs a quantum circuit encoding all possible spanning trees of the given graph and uses a quantum oracle to mark the states corresponding to the MDST. Grover's Algorithm is then employed to efficiently search the marked states. The main contributions of the paper are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A quantum algorithm to solve the MDST problem using Grover's Algorithm, offering a quadratic speedup over classical methods.
    \item A detailed analysis of the algorithm's complexity, correctness, and applicability to real-world problems.
    \item A comparison of the proposed approach with existing classical and quantum algorithms for solving the MDST problem.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:background} provides the necessary background on the MDST problem, Grover's Algorithm, and related work. Section \ref{sec:algorithm} presents the proposed quantum algorithm for solving the MDST problem, along with a detailed explanation of its components. Section \ref{sec:analysis} analyzes the algorithm's complexity, correctness, and applicability. Section \ref{sec:comparison} compares the proposed approach with existing methods, highlighting its advantages. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Minimum Degree Spanning Tree Problem}
The Minimum Degree Spanning Tree (MDST) problem is a combinatorial optimization problem defined on an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. The MDST problem seeks to find a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ such that the maximum degree of any vertex in $T$ is minimized. In other words, the MDST problem aims to minimize the maximum number of edges incident to any vertex in the spanning tree.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover} is a quantum search algorithm designed to find a marked item in an unsorted database of $N$ items with a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. The algorithm is based on the principles of quantum superposition and amplitude amplification, enabling it to search the marked item in $O(\sqrt{N})$ iterations. Grover's Algorithm has been successfully applied to various optimization problems and has become a cornerstone of quantum computing research.

\subsection{Related Work}
Several classical algorithms have been proposed for solving the MDST problem, such as the greedy algorithm \cite{greedy}, simulated annealing \cite{SA}, and genetic algorithms \cite{GA}. However, these algorithms are either based on heuristics or have exponential time complexity, limiting their applicability to large-scale problems. Recently, researchers have started exploring quantum algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem \cite{TSP} and the maximum clique problem \cite{MCP}. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to leverage Grover's Algorithm to solve the MDST problem.

\section{Minimum Degree Spanning Tree Problem}

The Minimum Degree Spanning Tree (MDST) problem is an optimization problem that deals with graphs. Given an undirected, connected graph with weighted edges, the goal of the MDST problem is to find a spanning tree of minimum degree, where the degree of a tree is the maximum degree of any vertex in the tree.

\subsection{Values in R0 and R1}

In the given ARM assembly code, two registers R0 and R1 contain values that cannot be changed. These values represent the total weight of the spanning tree and the number of edges in the spanning tree, respectively. The ARM assembly code aims to check whether these values correspond to a valid solution to the MDST problem for a graph with a maximum of three nodes.

Specifically, R0 stores the total weight of the spanning tree, which is the sum of the weights of all its edges. A valid solution to the MDST problem should have the minimum possible total weight for a given graph. R1 stores the number of edges in the spanning tree. In a graph with three nodes, a valid spanning tree should have two edges connecting the nodes.

\subsection{Algorithm Description}

The assembly code checks if the values stored in R0 and R1 are a valid solution to the MDST problem without using loops or branches, following a set of unbreakable requirements. The algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compare the value in R0 (total weight) with the expected total weight (3) for a graph with three nodes.
  \item If R0 is equal to the expected total weight, set R3 to 1; otherwise, set R3 to 0.
  \item Compare the value in R1 (number of edges) with the expected number of edges (2) for a graph with three nodes.
  \item If R1 is equal to the expected number of edges, set R6 to 1; otherwise, set R6 to 0.
  \item Perform a logical AND operation on R3 and R6 to check if both conditions are met (i.e., if R0 and R1 contain valid values for the MDST problem).
  \item If both conditions are met, set R8 to 1; otherwise, set R8 to 0.
  \item Finally, compare R8 with 1 and set the ZERO Program Status Register (PSR) flag accordingly. If R8 is equal to 1, the ZERO PSR flag will be set to 1, indicating that the values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution to the MDST problem. If R8 is not equal to 1, the ZERO PSR flag will be set to 0, indicating that the values in R0 and R1 are not a valid solution.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Efficiency and Limitations}

The algorithm is efficient in that it does not use loops or branches, minimizing the number of instructions executed by the processor. Instead, it relies on straightforward comparisons and logical operations to determine the validity of the values in R0 and R1. The algorithm is also compliant with the given unbreakable requirements, which dictate the use of specific ARM assembly instructions and restrictions on register usage.

However, the algorithm has some limitations. First, it is tailored to a graph with a maximum of three nodes. This constraint simplifies the MDST problem and provides a straightforward way to validate the solution. In general, the MDST problem is NP-hard, and finding an optimal solution for larger graphs would require more sophisticated algorithms.

Second, the algorithm assumes that the values stored in R0 and R1 cannot be changed. This means that the algorithm cannot dynamically adjust the total weight or the number of edges in the spanning tree. In practice, this may limit the applicability of the algorithm to cases where the total weight and number of edges are determined in advance and cannot be modified during the execution of the algorithm.

In summary, the assembly code provided implements an efficient algorithm for checking if the values in R0 and R1 correspond to a valid solution to the MDST problem for a graph with three nodes. Despite its limitations, the algorithm demonstrates a useful approach to solving the MDST problem using ARM assembly instructions and adhering to specific constraints on register usage and instruction sets.
