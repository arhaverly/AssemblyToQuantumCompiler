\section{Introduction}

The Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph (MkCS) problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding the largest subgraph of a given graph where no adjacent vertices share the same color, using at most $k$ colors. It is a generalization of the well-known Graph Coloring problem, which is to determine the chromatic number of a graph, i.e., the minimum number of colors required to color the graph without violating the color constraints. The MkCS problem has various applications in diverse fields such as scheduling, wireless networks, pattern recognition, and VLSI design \cite{garey1979,malik1994}.

The MkCS problem is NP-hard \cite{garey1979}, implying that no efficient classical algorithm is known to solve the problem in polynomial time unless P = NP. As a result, researchers have explored various heuristics and approximation algorithms to tackle this problem in practice \cite{johnson1985,galinier1999}. Recently, quantum computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to solve complex optimization problems faster than classical computing methods \cite{shor1994,grover1996}. Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to process and manipulate information in a fundamentally different manner than classical computing.

Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996} is a quantum search algorithm that has shown great potential in solving unstructured search problems. It can search an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms that require $O(N)$ time in the worst case. Grover's Algorithm has been extended and adapted to solve various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem \cite{zalka1999}, the satisfiability problem \cite{cerf2000}, and the Maximum Clique problem \cite{childs2000}.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the MkCS problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our proposed algorithm efficiently identifies the maximum k-colorable subgraph of a given graph, providing an exponential speedup over classical methods. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose a quantum algorithm for solving the Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph problem based on Grover's search algorithm, leveraging the power of quantum computing to tackle this NP-hard optimization problem.
    
    \item We provide a detailed explanation of the theoretical foundations and implementation of the proposed algorithm, including the construction of the quantum oracle, the Grover iteration process, and the overall framework of the algorithm.
    
    \item We analyze the performance and complexity of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its potential to outperform classical methods in solving practical MkCS instances.
    
    \item We discuss the implications and possible extensions of our work, contributing to the ongoing research on quantum computing techniques for combinatorial optimization problems.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} provides the necessary background on Grover's Algorithm and the Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph problem. Section \ref{sec:algorithm} presents the proposed quantum algorithm for solving the MkCS problem and describes its implementation in detail. Section \ref{sec:analysis} analyzes the performance and complexity of the proposed algorithm, comparing it with classical methods. Section \ref{sec:discussion} discusses the implications and possible extensions of our work. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and summarizes our findings.



\section{Problem Definition}

In the Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph problem, we are given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ represents the set of vertices and $E$ represents the set of edges. The goal is to find the largest subgraph of $G$ where at most $k$ colors can be used to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This problem is a variant of the classical graph coloring problem.

In our ARM assembly implementation, we represent the number of vertices in the graph by the value stored in the register R0 and the number of colors available for coloring the vertices by the value stored in register R1. Both the values in R0 and R1 cannot be changed, and we need to decide if these values are a valid solution to the Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph problem. For the sake of simplicity, we have restricted the largest number of vertices to 3 in this example.

\section{Algorithm Description}

Our algorithm checks if the given values in R0 and R1 can form a valid solution to the Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph problem without using loops or branches. We use the following registers for our implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item R0: Number of vertices in the graph
    \item R1: Number of colors available for coloring
    \item R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6: Temporary registers for storing intermediate results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Checking Validity of Vertices and Colors}

First, we check if the number of vertices (R0) is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3. We also check if the number of colors available (R1) is greater than 0.

To perform these checks, we use the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set the value of R2 to 1 and R3 to 3.
    \item Subtract 1 from R0 and store the result in R2. This will check if R0 is greater than 0.
    \item Subtract 3 from R0 and store the result in R3. This will check if R0 is less than or equal to 3.
    \item Subtract 1 from R1 and store the result in R4. This will check if R1 is greater than 0.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Combining Conditions}

After checking the validity of the number of vertices and colors, we need to combine these conditions to determine if the values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution to the problem.

To do this, we perform the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform a bitwise AND operation between R2 and R3, and store the result in R5. This will check if R0 is greater than 0 AND R0 is less than or equal to 3.
    \item Perform a bitwise AND operation between R5 and R4, and store the result in R6. This will check if (R0 is greater than 0 AND R0 is less than or equal to 3) AND R1 is greater than 0.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

Finally, we need to set the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag to indicate whether the values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution to the problem. The flag is set to 1 if the values are a valid solution, and 0 otherwise.

To set the flag, we perform a bitwise AND operation between R6 and R2 and then use the Test (TST) instruction to set the ZERO PSR flag accordingly.

\section{Efficiency and Limitations}

Our algorithm efficiently checks the validity of the values in R0 and R1 without using loops, branches, or labels. However, the algorithm is limited by the fact that it only works for graphs with at most 3 vertices, and it assumes that the values in R0 and R1 cannot be changed. Additionally, the algorithm uses a limited set of ARM assembly instructions, which restricts its flexibility and versatility. Nevertheless, the algorithm provides a simple and efficient solution to the Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph problem for small graphs under the given constraints.
