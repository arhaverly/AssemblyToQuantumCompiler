% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The Maximum Dispersion Problem (MDP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that arises in various applications, such as facility location, data compression, and pattern recognition \cite{mdp_applications}. Given a set of objects and a distance measure, the goal is to select a subset of these objects in such a way that the minimum pairwise distance between them is maximized. Despite its apparent simplicity, the MDP is known to be NP-hard, meaning that finding the optimal solution can be computationally infeasible for large problem instances \cite{mdp_np_hard}.

In recent years, the field of quantum computing has experienced rapid growth, with many researchers exploring the potential of quantum algorithms to provide significant speedups over classical algorithms for a variety of problems \cite{quantum_computing}. One of the most well-known quantum algorithms is Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover}, which allows for the quadratic speedup of unstructured search problems. While Grover's Algorithm has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, its application to combinatorial optimization problems, such as the MDP, has remained largely unexplored.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the MDP using Grover's Algorithm, demonstrating the potential of quantum algorithms to address combinatorial optimization problems efficiently. We achieve this by formulating the MDP as an instance of an unstructured search problem and then applying Grover's Algorithm to find the optimal solution. Our approach leverages the unique properties of quantum computing, such as superposition and entanglement, to explore the solution space more efficiently than classical algorithms.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:background} provides the necessary background on the MDP and Grover's Algorithm. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present our proposed algorithm for solving the MDP using Grover's Algorithm, along with a detailed description of the quantum circuit implementation. Section \ref{sec:analysis} analyzes the complexity and performance of our proposed algorithm, comparing it to classical approaches and highlighting the benefits of our quantum approach. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper with a summary of our results and a discussion of possible future research directions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
In this section, we provide an overview of the Maximum Dispersion Problem (MDP) and Grover's Algorithm, which are the main subjects of our research.

\subsection{Maximum Dispersion Problem}
The Maximum Dispersion Problem (MDP) can be formally defined as follows. Given a set of $n$ objects $S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n\}$ and a distance function $d: S \times S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$, the task is to find a subset $S' \subseteq S$ of size $m$ such that the minimum pairwise distance between the elements in $S'$ is maximized. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mdp}
    \max_{S' \subseteq S, |S'| = m} \min_{s_i, s_j \in S', i \neq j} d(s_i, s_j).
\end{equation}

The MDP is known to be NP-hard \cite{mdp_np_hard}, which implies that finding an optimal solution can be computationally expensive for large instances of the problem. A variety of classical algorithms have been proposed to address the MDP, including exact algorithms, such as branch-and-bound and dynamic programming, as well as approximation algorithms, such as greedy and local search heuristics \cite{mdp_classical_algorithms}. However, these algorithms often struggle to find optimal solutions within a reasonable time frame for large problem instances.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that was introduced by Lov Grover in 1996 \cite{grover}. Given a search space of size $N$, the algorithm allows for finding a target element with a known property in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, providing a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms, which require $O(N)$ steps in the best case.

Grover's Algorithm relies on a quantum oracle, which is a black box that can recognize the target element(s) by flipping the sign of their amplitudes in a given quantum state. The algorithm iteratively applies the Grover iteration, which consists of the oracle and the diffusion operator, to amplify the amplitudes of the target elements and suppress the amplitudes of the non-target elements. After a sufficient number of iterations, the target element(s) can be found with high probability by measuring the quantum state.

The success of Grover's Algorithm in providing a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems has motivated researchers to explore its applications to other problems, such as constraint satisfaction, graph traversal, and optimization \cite{grover_applications}. In this paper, we investigate the application of Grover's Algorithm to the MDP, aiming to harness the power of quantum computing to address this challenging combinatorial optimization problem.

\section{Problem Definition}
In this paper, we consider the Maximum Dispersion Problem (MDP) which involves finding the maximum difference between two numbers. Given two numbers, R0 and R1, the goal is to determine whether the difference between these values is equal to the maximum allowed difference. In this particular instance, the maximum allowed difference is 3. 

The Maximum Dispersion Problem has applications in various fields such as operations research, scheduling, and clustering. In this research paper, we focus on solving the MDP using ARM assembly code, specifically adhering to a given set of rules and constraints. This algorithm's efficiency plays a crucial role, as it will be executed on a limited-resource computer.

\section{Algorithm Description}
Our proposed algorithm aims to solve the MDP using ARM assembly code, while adhering to the specified constraints. The algorithm analyzes the values in R0 and R1, and determines if the absolute difference between them is equal to the maximum allowed difference (3). The result is then stored in the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag, with a value of 1 indicating that the values in R0 and R1 are a solution to the MDP, and 0 indicating otherwise.

To achieve this, we perform the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate the difference between R0 and R1, storing the result in R2.
    \item Calculate the difference between R1 and R0, storing the result in R3.
    \item Compare R2 with 3, setting the condition flags accordingly.
    \item Compare R3 with -3 (which is equivalent to R0 - R1 = 3), setting the condition flags accordingly.
    \item Perform a bitwise XOR operation between R2 and R3, storing the result in R4. This step effectively combines the results of the previous comparisons. If either R2 or R3 is non-zero, R4 will also be non-zero.
    \item Test R4 with -1 (which is represented as all 1s in binary), and set the ZERO PSR flag accordingly. This step determines if R4 is non-zero, indicating that either R2 or R3 is non-zero and thus the values in R0 and R1 represent a solution to the MDP.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Algorithm Constraints}
The algorithm is designed to strictly adhere to the given set of constraints, which are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do not use certain instructions, such as MUL, MLA, B, BEQ, BNE, MOVEQ, MOVNE, ADDS, ADDNE, ADDEQ, ANDS, ORREQ, ORRNE, CMPEQ, CMPNE, CMEQ, CMNE, and SUBS.
    \item Each register can only be used once.
    \item A register cannot be used twice in an instruction.
    \item Only use allowed ARM assembly instructions.
    \item Branches, loops, and labels are not allowed.
    \item Signify the beginning and end of the assembly code using "START\_ASSEMBLY" and "END\_ASSEMBLY".
    \item Labels are not allowed.
    \item Registers must follow the format R0, R1, etc.
    \item Comments are denoted by the ';' character.
    \item Immediate values cannot be in hex or binary.
    \item The ZERO PSR flag can only be set once.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Algorithm Efficiency}
Our proposed algorithm is designed to efficiently solve the MDP while adhering to the given constraints. By avoiding branches, loops, and labels, the algorithm executes in a linear fashion, making it suitable for limited-resource computers. Furthermore, the algorithm uses only basic ARM assembly instructions, ensuring that it can be executed on a wide range of ARM processors. The use of the ZERO PSR flag as the result indicator allows for easy interpretation and reduces the need for additional calculations or register manipulation.

In conclusion, our algorithm effectively solves the Maximum Dispersion Problem using ARM assembly code while adhering to the specified constraints. The algorithm's efficiency and simplicity make it suitable for execution on limited-resource computers, and its versatility ensures compatibility with a wide range of ARM processors.

As future research directions, it would be interesting to explore the applicability of other quantum algorithms, such as quantum annealing or the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), to the MDP and other combinatorial optimization problems. Additionally, investigating the potential of quantum computing to provide not only speedup but also improved solution quality through enhanced exploration of the solution space could lead to further advances in the field. Finally, as quantum hardware continues to evolve, experimental validation of our proposed algorithm on real quantum devices could provide valuable insights into the practical performance and limitations of quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems.
