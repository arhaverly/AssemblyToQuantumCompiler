\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The Multidimensional Knapsack problem (MKP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that has been extensively studied in the fields of operations research, computer science, and economics. It is a generalization of the well-known 0-1 Knapsack problem, where multiple constraints are present. The problem can be formally defined as follows: given a set of $n$ items, each with a profit $p_i$ and a size $s_{ij}$ in $m$ dimensions, the goal is to find a subset of the items to maximize the total profit while satisfying the capacity constraints in each dimension. The problem can be represented mathematically as:

\begin{align*}
    &\max \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i x_i \\
    &\text{subject to} \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_{ij} x_i \leq c_j, \quad j = 1, \ldots, m \\
    &x_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad i = 1, \ldots, n
\end{align*}

where $x_i$ is a binary variable indicating whether item $i$ is included in the knapsack or not, and $c_j$ represents the capacity constraint in the $j$-th dimension.

The MKP is NP-hard, which implies that there is no known algorithm that can solve it efficiently in the worst case for all instances. Over the years, several classical algorithms have been proposed to solve the MKP, including exact algorithms, such as branch and bound, dynamic programming, and cutting planes, and approximate algorithms, such as greedy heuristics, metaheuristics, and evolutionary algorithms. However, these algorithms have limitations in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality, especially for large-scale instances.

Quantum computing, a paradigm that exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations, has shown potential in solving various optimization problems more efficiently than classical computing. Grover's algorithm, one of the most celebrated quantum algorithms, allows for searching an unstructured database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms \cite{grover1996}. This algorithm has been adapted to solve several combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem \cite{zalka1999}, the maximum clique problem \cite{childs2017}, and the graph coloring problem \cite{daskin2020}.

In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving the Multidimensional Knapsack problem based on Grover's algorithm. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We present a novel quantum algorithm for the MKP, which leverages the quadratic speedup provided by Grover's algorithm to enhance the efficiency of finding an optimal or near-optimal solution.
    \item We provide a detailed analysis of the proposed algorithm, including its time complexity and comparisons with classical algorithms.
    \item We discuss potential practical applications of our approach in various domains, such as resource allocation, scheduling, and cryptography.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
\label{subsec:grover}
Grover's algorithm \cite{grover1996}, a quantum algorithm for searching an unstructured database, was initially proposed for finding a unique item that satisfies a given condition. The algorithm's main advantage is its quadratic speedup compared to classical search algorithms, which allows it to find the desired item in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, where $N$ is the size of the database.

The key components of Grover's algorithm are the Grover iteration (also known as the Grover operator) and the oracle. The Grover iteration consists of two main steps: the oracle operation and the diffusion operation. The oracle is a black-box function that can identify the desired item by flipping its sign in the quantum state. The diffusion operation amplifies the amplitude of the desired item while reducing the amplitudes of the other items, making it more likely to be found when measuring the quantum state.

Grover's algorithm can be extended to find multiple items that satisfy a given condition, with a slight increase in the number of iterations required. This extension has been used to adapt Grover's algorithm to solve various combinatorial optimization problems, where the goal is to find a solution that optimizes a given objective function. In such applications, the oracle is designed to identify solutions that meet specific optimality criteria, and the algorithm iteratively refines the search space until an optimal or near-optimal solution is found.

\subsection{Quantum Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization}
\label{subsec:quantum_comb_opt}
Applying Grover's algorithm to combinatorial optimization problems involves two main steps: encoding the problem in a quantum state and designing an oracle that can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions. Various approaches have been proposed for encoding combinatorial optimization problems in quantum states, such as binary encoding, unary encoding, and hybrid encoding \cite{nielsen_chuang_2010}. The choice of encoding depends on the problem's structure and the desired trade-off between the number of qubits and the complexity of the oracle.

Designing an oracle for a combinatorial optimization problem typically involves two main tasks: checking the feasibility of a solution and evaluating its optimality. In some cases, the feasibility check and the optimality evaluation can be combined into a single operation, which simplifies the oracle's implementation. In other cases, it may be necessary to use multiple oracles or auxiliary qubits to perform these tasks efficiently.

Several quantum algorithms have been proposed for combinatorial optimization problems based on Grover's algorithm, such as the traveling salesman problem \cite{zalka1999}, the maximum clique problem \cite{childs2017}, and the graph coloring problem \cite{daskin2020}. These algorithms share a common structure: they initialize a quantum state that represents the search space, apply the Grover iteration to refine the search space, and measure the final quantum state to obtain an optimal or near-optimal solution. The main differences between these algorithms lie in the encoding of the problem and the design of the oracle.

In the next section, we present our quantum algorithm for the Multidimensional Knapsack problem based on Grover's algorithm, and discuss its main components, including the encoding and the oracle.

\section{Quantum Algorithm for the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem}
\label{sec:algorithm}

Our proposed quantum algorithm for the MKP is based on Grover's algorithm and involves three main components: encoding the problem in a quantum state, designing an oracle that can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions, and applying the Grover iteration to refine the search space. In this section, we describe each of these components in detail.

\subsection{Problem Encoding}
\label{subsec:encoding}
To encode the Multidimensional Knapsack problem in a quantum state, we use a binary encoding, representing each solution as a bit string of length $n$. Each bit corresponds to an item, with 1 indicating that the item is included in the knapsack, and 0 indicating that it is not. This encoding allows us to represent the search space of the MKP as a set of $2^n$ possible solutions, which can be mapped to a quantum state with $n$ qubits.

We initialize the quantum state by applying a Hadamard transformation to each qubit, which creates a uniform superposition of all possible solutions:

\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n} \ket{x}.
\end{equation}

This initial state represents the entire search space of the MKP and serves as the starting point for the Grover iteration.

\subsection{Oracle Design}
\label{subsec:oracle}
The oracle for our quantum algorithm is designed to identify solutions that satisfy the capacity constraints of the MKP and have a profit above a certain threshold. This threshold is initially set to a lower bound on the optimal profit, and is

\section{Multidimensional Knapsack Problem}
The Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) is an NP-hard optimization problem that has various applications in areas such as resource allocation, budgeting, and transportation. Given a set of items, where each item has a certain weight and value, and a knapsack with a limited carrying capacity, the aim is to determine a combination of items that maximizes the total value without exceeding the knapsack's weight capacity. In this paper, we consider a simplified variant of the problem, which we call the 0/1 MKP, assuming that each item can be taken at most once.

In our ARM assembly code, we use two registers, R0 and R1, to store the total weight of the items and the maximum weight allowed for the knapsack, respectively. Moreover, we use the ZERO PSR flag to indicate whether the current combination of items yields a valid solution to the 0/1 MKP. We consider the largest number allowed for our example to be 3.

\section{Algorithm Description}
Our ARM assembly code implements a simple and efficient algorithm for determining whether the combination of items represented by the values in registers R0 and R1 provides a valid solution for the 0/1 MKP. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compare the total weight of the items (R0) with the maximum weight allowed for the knapsack (R1).
\item Perform a bitwise AND operation on R0 and R1, storing the result in register R2.
\item Calculate the difference between the maximum weight allowed and the total weight of the items using the Reverse Subtract (RSB) instruction, and store the result in register R3.
\item Compare R3 with R2 using the Test Equality (TEQ) instruction, which sets the ZERO PSR flag if the two values are equal or clears the flag otherwise.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Algorithm Analysis}
The main idea behind our algorithm is to efficiently determine whether the total weight of the items (R0) does not exceed the maximum weight allowed for the knapsack (R1). This is achieved through a series of arithmetic and bitwise operations, allowing for a fast and resource-efficient evaluation of the problem.

First, we compare the values of R0 and R1 using the Compare (CMP) instruction. This instruction updates the condition flags in the PSR (Program Status Register) based on the result of the subtraction R0 - R1. The flags affected are N (negative), Z (zero), C (carry), and V (overflow).

Next, we perform a bitwise AND operation on R0 and R1. This operation keeps the bits that are set in both R0 and R1 and clears all other bits. The result is saved in register R2. This step is essential for the subsequent comparison between the difference of the maximum weight and the total weight (R3) and the result of the AND operation (R2).

The Reverse Subtract (RSB) instruction is then used to compute the difference between the maximum weight allowed (R1) and the total weight (R0), storing the result in register R3. This step allows us to determine whether the current combination of items exceeds the knapsack's weight capacity.

Finally, we use the Test Equality (TEQ) instruction to compare the values of R3 and R2. If the difference R3 is greater than or equal to 0, the total weight of the items does not exceed the maximum weight allowed for the knapsack, and the solution is considered valid. In this case, the ZERO PSR flag is set. If the difference R3 is less than 0, the solution is deemed invalid, and the flag is not set.

\section{Conclusion}
In summary, our ARM assembly code provides an efficient and straightforward method for evaluating the validity of a given combination of items in the context of the 0/1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem. By utilizing a series of arithmetic and bitwise operations, the algorithm quickly determines whether the total weight of the items exceeds the knapsack's weight capacity. This approach can be extended and adapted for more complex instances of the problem, potentially leading to further optimization and resource-saving solutions.
