\section{Introduction}

The Graph Partitioning problem is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with numerous applications in areas such as VLSI design~\cite{vlsi}, parallel computing~\cite{parallel}, and data mining~\cite{data_mining}. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the objective is to divide the set of vertices into two equal-sized partitions $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that the number of edges connecting the two partitions is minimized. In mathematical terms, the problem can be formulated as:

\begin{equation}
\min_{V_1, V_2} \sum_{i \in V_1, j \in V_2} w_{ij},
\end{equation}

where $w_{ij}$ represents the weight of the edge between vertices $i$ and $j$. Since the Graph Partitioning problem is NP-hard, finding an exact solution is often infeasible for large-scale instances. As a result, various heuristic and approximation algorithms have been proposed to tackle the problem, such as the Kernighan-Lin algorithm~\cite{kernighan_lin} and spectral methods~\cite{spectral}.

In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex computational problems that are intractable on classical computers. Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization~\cite{shor} and Grover's algorithm for unstructured search~\cite{grover}, have demonstrated the potential to significantly outperform their classical counterparts. In this paper, we explore the application of Grover's Algorithm to solve the Graph Partitioning problem.

Grover's Algorithm, introduced by Lov Grover in 1996~\cite{grover}, provides a quantum-based search algorithm that enables searching an unsorted database of size $N$ in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, offering a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. The algorithm has been successfully applied to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman problem~\cite{travelling_salesman} and the Maximum Clique problem~\cite{maximum_clique}. However, its application to the Graph Partitioning problem has not yet been thoroughly investigated.

Our main contribution in this paper is the development of a novel quantum algorithm for solving the Graph Partitioning problem using Grover's Algorithm. We leverage the power of quantum search to efficiently explore the solution space and identify balanced partitions with minimal edge-cut weights. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the time complexity and resource requirements for our algorithm, highlighting the advantages of our approach compared to classical algorithms. Our results indicate that our quantum algorithm can potentially outperform existing classical solutions in terms of both runtime and solution quality, thereby paving the way for practical applications of quantum computing in combinatorial optimization.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:background} provides a brief background on Grover's Algorithm and the Graph Partitioning problem. Section~\ref{sec:algorithm} presents our proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Graph Partitioning problem. In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we analyze the time complexity and resource requirements of our algorithm, and compare it with classical algorithms. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and discusses future research directions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide a brief overview of Grover's Algorithm and the Graph Partitioning problem to establish the foundation for our proposed quantum algorithm.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm~\cite{grover} is a quantum search algorithm that allows searching an unsorted database of size $N$ with $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search methods. The algorithm relies on two main operations: the oracle $O$ and the Grover diffusion operator $D$. The oracle $O$ is a unitary operator that marks the target element by inverting its sign, while the Grover diffusion operator $D$ amplifies the amplitudes of the marked elements in the quantum state.

The algorithm proceeds in iterations, with each iteration consisting of applying the oracle $O$ and the Grover diffusion operator $D$. After approximately $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$ iterations, the quantum state converges to the target element with high probability. The target element can then be extracted by measuring the quantum state.

\subsection{Graph Partitioning Problem}

The Graph Partitioning problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that involves dividing a graph into two equal-sized partitions such that the edge-cut weight is minimized. The problem can be formally defined as follows:

\begin{definition}
(Graph Partitioning Problem) Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, the Graph Partitioning problem is to find two disjoint vertex subsets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that $|V_1|=|V_2|=\frac{n}{2}$ and the edge-cut weight $\sum_{i \in V_1, j \in V_2} w_{ij}$ is minimized.
\end{definition}

The Graph Partitioning problem has numerous applications in various domains, such as VLSI design, parallel computing, and data mining. However, due to its NP-hard nature, finding exact solutions is often computationally infeasible for large-scale instances. Various approximation and heuristic algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but their performance is often limited by the inherent complexity of the problem.

\section{Proposed Quantum Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we present our novel quantum algorithm for solving the Graph Partitioning problem using Grover's Algorithm. The key idea of our approach is to leverage the quantum search capabilities of Grover's Algorithm to efficiently explore the solution space and identify balanced partitions with minimal edge-cut weights.

\subsection{Algorithm Description}

Our proposed algorithm consists of the following main steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prepare an initial quantum state $|\psi_0\rangle$ that represents all possible partitions of the graph.
\item Iteratively apply Grover's Algorithm to the initial quantum state $|\psi_0\rangle$ to search for a target partition with minimal edge-cut weight.
\item Measure the final quantum state to obtain the optimal partition.
\end{enumerate}

To realize this algorithm, we need to design a suitable oracle $O$ and Grover diffusion operator $D$ for the Graph Partitioning problem. The oracle $O$ should be capable of marking partitions with minimal edge-cut weight, while the Grover diffusion operator $D$ should amplify the amplitudes of the marked partitions in the quantum state.

\subsection{Oracle Design}

The oracle $O$ for the Graph Partitioning problem can be designed using the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Encode each partition $P$ of the graph as a binary string $b(P)$ of length $n$, where the $i$-th bit of the string represents the membership of vertex $i$ in the partition ($0$ for $V_1$ and $1$ for $V_2$).
\item Define a function $f(P)$ that maps a partition $P$ to its edge-cut weight, i.e., $f(P)=\sum_{i \in V_1, j \in V_2} w_{ij}$.
\item Construct a quantum oracle $O$ that marks the target partition $P^*$ with minimal edge-cut weight by inverting its sign, i.e., $O|P\rangle=(-1)^{f(P^*)}|P\rangle$.
\end{enumerate}

This oracle design allows us to efficiently mark the target partition with minimal edge-cut weight in the quantum state, enabling the quantum search process of Grover's Algorithm.

\subsection{Grover Diffusion Operator Design}

The Grover diffusion operator $D$ for the Graph Partitioning problem can be designed using the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the average amplitude $\alpha$ of the marked partitions in the quantum state, i.e., $\alpha=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{P} \langle P|O|P\rangle$.
\item Define a reflection operator $R$ that reflects the amplitudes of the partitions around the average amplitude $\alpha$, i.e., $R|P\rangle=2\alpha|P\rangle-\langle P|O|P\rangle$.
\item Construct the Grover diffusion operator $D$ as the product of the reflection operator $R$ and

\section{Graph Partitioning Problem and Representation}

The Graph Partitioning problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem, where the goal is to divide the vertices of a given graph into two disjoint subsets while minimizing the weight of the edges connecting the two subsets. In the context of this problem, the values in R0 and R1 represent the total weights of the two disjoint subsets obtained by partitioning the graph. A valid solution to the Graph Partitioning problem is one where the difference between the weights of the two subsets is minimized, ideally reaching zero.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

The provided ARM assembly code is designed to check if the values stored in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Graph Partitioning problem. It does so by comparing the difference between the weights of the two subsets and setting the ZERO flag in the Program Status Register (PSR) if the difference is zero. This implies that both subsets have the same weight, and thus the partition is balanced.

\section{Algorithm Description}

The ARM assembly code can be broken down into three main stages: copying the input values, calculating the absolute difference between the weights, and comparing the absolute difference with 0.

\subsection{Copying the Input Values}

In order to preserve the original values of R0 and R1, the algorithm starts by copying these values into new registers, R2 and R3, respectively. This is done using the MOV instruction:

\begin{verbatim}
    MOV R2, R0
    MOV R3, R1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Calculating the Absolute Difference}

The next step is to calculate the absolute difference between the weights stored in R2 and R3. This is achieved by first subtracting R3 from R2 and storing the result in R4:

\begin{verbatim}
    SUB R4, R2, R3
\end{verbatim}

To obtain the absolute value of this difference, the algorithm uses a combination of bitwise operations. First, the RSB (Reverse Subtract) instruction is used to negate R4 and store the result in R5:

\begin{verbatim}
    RSB R5, R4, #0
\end{verbatim}

The algorithm then proceeds with the following series of bitwise operations:

\begin{verbatim}
    EOR R6, R4, R5
    BIC R7, R6, R4
    LSR R8, R7, #31
    ADD R9, R4, R8
    EOR R10, R9, R8
    SUB R5, R10, R8
\end{verbatim}

These operations essentially perform a conditional negation on the result in R4. If R4 is negative, the result in R5 will be the negation of R4, effectively computing the absolute value of the difference. If R4 is non-negative, R5 will remain unchanged, as it already contains the absolute value of the difference.

\subsection{Comparing the Absolute Difference with 0}

The final stage of the algorithm is to compare the absolute difference in R5 with 0. If the difference is zero, it means that both subsets have the same weight, and the partition is a valid solution to the Graph Partitioning problem. This is done using the CMP instruction:

\begin{verbatim}
    CMP R5, #0
\end{verbatim}

Upon executing this instruction, the ZERO flag in the PSR will be set if the absolute difference is zero, indicating a valid solution.

\section{Efficiency Considerations}

The provided assembly code is designed to be efficient, adhering to the constraints of using a limited set of ARM instructions and registers. No loops or branching instructions are used, which simplifies the code and reduces the number of instructions executed. Furthermore, the algorithm directly operates on the ARM processor, ensuring that the immediate values are written out and that the ZERO PSR flag is set only once. This makes the code suitable for running on resource-constrained systems.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
