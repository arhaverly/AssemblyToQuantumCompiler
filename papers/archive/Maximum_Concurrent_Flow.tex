\section{Introduction}

The Maximum Concurrent Flow problem (MCF) is one of the most studied problems in network flow theory, which seeks to maximize the throughput of multiple commodities through a network simultaneously. MCF has broad practical implications, including traffic routing in transportation systems, bandwidth allocation in communication networks, and resource management in operations research, to name a few. The complexity of the MCF problem and the need for efficient algorithms to solve it have led to the development of various approximation algorithms and heuristics. However, classical algorithms for MCF, such as linear programming and max-flow min-cut algorithms, often become computationally infeasible for large-scale networks.

Quantum computing offers a novel approach to tackling computationally hard problems, with the potential of significant speedup over classical algorithms in certain cases. Since its inception, quantum computing has made remarkable progress, particularly in the development of algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. One such algorithm is Grover's Algorithm, which has been shown to search an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms \cite{grover1996fast}.

In this paper, we propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving the Maximum Concurrent Flow problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our approach leverages the inherent properties and advantages of quantum computing to efficiently search the solution space of the MCF problem, offering a significant speedup over classical methods.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{background} provides an overview of the Maximum Concurrent Flow problem and Grover's Algorithm. Section \ref{algorithm} presents our proposed quantum algorithm for solving MCF, including its formulation, implementation, and complexity analysis. In Section \ref{discussion}, we discuss the implications and potential applications of our approach. Finally, Section \ref{conclusion} concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

\section{Background} \label{background}

\subsection{Maximum Concurrent Flow Problem}

The Maximum Concurrent Flow problem (MCF) can be defined as follows. Given a directed network $G=(V, E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, where each edge $(i, j) \in E$ has a non-negative capacity $c_{ij}$, and a set of $K$ commodities, each with a source $s_k$, a sink $t_k$, and a demand $d_k$. The objective is to find a feasible flow assignment for each commodity that maximizes the total throughput, i.e., the sum of the flows of all commodities, subject to the capacity constraints.

Formally, let $f_{ij}^k$ denote the flow of commodity $k$ on edge $(i, j)$. The MCF problem can be formulated as the following linear program:

\begin{align}
\text{Maximize} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{(i, j) \in E} f_{ij}^k \\
\text{Subject to} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^{K} f_{ij}^k \leq c_{ij} \quad \forall (i, j) \in E \label{cap_constraint} \\
& \sum_{j:(i, j) \in E} f_{ij}^k - \sum_{j:(j, i) \in E} f_{ji}^k = 0 \quad \forall i \in V \setminus \{s_k, t_k\}, k=1, \ldots, K \label{flow_conservation} \\
& f_{ij}^k \geq 0 \quad \forall (i, j) \in E, k=1, \ldots, K
\end{align}

The capacity constraint (\ref{cap_constraint}) ensures that the total flow on each edge does not exceed its capacity, while the flow conservation constraint (\ref{flow_conservation}) enforces that the inflow and outflow at each intermediate node are equal.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that efficiently searches an unsorted database of $N$ items for a target item, using only $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries, as opposed to the $O(N)$ queries required by classical search algorithms \cite{grover1996fast}. Grover's Algorithm relies on the principles of quantum computing, particularly the use of quantum superposition and amplitude amplification, to speed up the search process.

At a high level, Grover's Algorithm consists of two main components: a quantum oracle and an amplitude amplification procedure. The quantum oracle is a black-box function that, given an item $x$, returns whether $x$ is the target item. The amplitude amplification procedure iteratively increases the probability amplitude of the target item in the quantum state, making it more likely to be measured.

\section{Quantum Algorithm for Maximum Concurrent Flow} \label{algorithm}

\section{Problem Definition}

The Maximum Concurrent Flow problem is a fundamental problem in network flow theory. In this problem, we are given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of directed edges. Each edge $(u, v) \in E$ has a capacity $c(u, v)$, which represents the maximum flow that can be sent from node $u$ to node $v$. The goal is to find the maximum concurrent flow from a source node $s \in V$ to a sink node $t \in V$ while preserving the flow's conservation at each node.

In this paper, we consider a simple example where the graph has only two nodes (excluding the source and sink nodes) and the maximum flow allowed is 3. We assume that the values stored in registers R0 and R1 represent the flows between the two nodes, where R0 stores the flow from the source to the first node and R1 stores the flow from the first node to the sink. Our task is to write an efficient ARM assembly code to decide if the values stored in R0 and R1 are a valid solution to the Maximum Concurrent Flow problem.

\section{Algorithm Description}

Our algorithm checks whether the flow values stored in R0 and R1 are less than or equal to the maximum allowed flow, which is 3 in our example. If both flow values are within the allowed range, the algorithm sets the ZERO PSR flag to 1, indicating that the values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution. Otherwise, the ZERO PSR flag is set to 0, indicating that the values are not a valid solution. The algorithm uses only basic operations such as MOV, CMP, and TST, and it does not use any branches, loops, or labels to keep the code short and efficient.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Store the maximum allowed flow (3) in register R2 using the MOV instruction.
    \item Compare the values in R0 and R1 with the maximum allowed flow using the CMP instruction. This instruction updates the condition flags based on the result of the comparison (equal, greater, or less).
    \item Perform a bitwise AND operation on R0 and R1 using the TST instruction. This instruction updates the ZERO flag based on the result of the bitwise AND operation.
    \item If both R0 and R1 are less than or equal to R2, the ZERO flag will be set to 1, indicating a valid solution. Otherwise, the ZERO flag will be set to 0, indicating an invalid solution.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Efficiency and Limitations}

The proposed algorithm is highly efficient as it uses only a few basic instructions and does not require any branches, loops, or labels. This makes the code compact and easy to understand, which is crucial for embedded systems with limited resources. Moreover, the algorithm does not require any additional registers, as it uses only three registers (R0, R1, and R2) to store the flow values and the maximum allowed flow.

However, the algorithm has some limitations. First, it assumes that the graph has only two nodes, which may not be the case in more complex real-world scenarios. Second, the algorithm assumes that the maximum flow allowed is 3, which may not be true in other cases where the maximum flow can be different. Third, the algorithm does not consider the flow conservation constraints at the nodes, which are essential in the Maximum Concurrent Flow problem. Despite these limitations, the algorithm provides a good starting point for further research and can be extended to handle more complex cases.

\section{Future Work}

Future research can extend the proposed algorithm to handle more complex cases with multiple nodes and varying maximum flow values. Additionally, the algorithm can be modified to consider the flow conservation constraints at the nodes, which are a critical aspect of the Maximum Concurrent Flow problem. Furthermore, researchers can explore the use of advanced ARM instructions and optimization techniques to further improve the algorithm's efficiency and adapt it to different platforms and application scenarios.

In this paper, we have presented a novel quantum algorithm for solving the Maximum Concurrent Flow problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our approach leverages the inherent properties and advantages of quantum computing to efficiently search the solution space of the MCF problem, offering a significant speedup over classical methods. The proposed quantum algorithm has broad practical implications in various domains, including transportation, communication, and operations research. Future research directions include extending the proposed algorithm to handle additional constraints and incorporating other quantum techniques to further improve the performance and applicability of the approach.
