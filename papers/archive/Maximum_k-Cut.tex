\section{Introduction}

The Maximum k-Cut problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem, which has been extensively studied in the literature due to its numerous applications in diverse fields such as VLSI design, telecommunication, statistical physics, and social network analysis, among others \cite{barahona1992maximum, chopra1994partition, karp1972reducibility}. In its most general form, the problem can be defined on a weighted, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, where each edge $e \in E$ is assigned a non-negative weight $w(e)$. The objective is to partition the vertices of the graph into k disjoint sets, such that the sum of the weights of the edges with endpoints in distinct sets is maximized.

Despite its simple formulation, the Maximum k-Cut problem is known to be NP-hard for $k \geq 2$ \cite{karp1972reducibility}, which implies that finding an exact polynomial-time algorithm for the problem is unlikely, unless P = NP. As a consequence, a wide variety of heuristic and approximation algorithms have been proposed in the literature to tackle the problem, including branch-and-bound methods, local search techniques, and semidefinite programming-based approaches, among others \cite{barahona1992maximum, chopra1994partition, fuerer1997approximation}. However, these classical algorithms often suffer from limitations in terms of scalability and efficiency, especially for large-scale instances of the problem.

Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging field that offers the potential to revolutionize our computational capabilities by exploiting the unique properties of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computation and information processing tasks in a fundamentally different way than classical computing \cite{nielsen2002quantum}. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, as these problems are often characterized by large, complex solution spaces that can be challenging to explore efficiently using classical methods.

One of the most well-known quantum algorithms is Grover's algorithm \cite{grover1996fast}, which provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms in terms of the number of evaluations of an unstructured database or function. Grover's algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of problems, such as satisfiability, graph coloring, and traveling salesman problem, among others \cite{childs2017quantum, hadfield2019quantum}.

In this paper, we propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving the Maximum k-Cut problem using Grover's algorithm. Our approach leverages the power of quantum computing to explore the solution space more efficiently, potentially leading to significant reductions in computational complexity for large-scale instances of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize Grover's algorithm for the Maximum k-Cut problem, thus contributing to the growing body of literature on quantum combinatorial optimization.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we provide the necessary background on Grover's algorithm and the Maximum k-Cut problem. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present a detailed description of our proposed quantum algorithm, along with a thorough complexity analysis. In Section \ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss the practical implications of our approach for real-world applications and compare its performance with existing classical algorithms. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper and outline possible directions for future research.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide a brief overview of the essential concepts and techniques related to Grover's algorithm and the Maximum k-Cut problem, which will be used throughout the paper.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that allows for the efficient searching of an unstructured database or function, achieving a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. The algorithm was originally proposed by Grover in 1996 \cite{grover1996fast} and has since become one of the most well-known quantum algorithms, mainly due to its wide applicability and ease of implementation on quantum hardware.

The main idea behind Grover's algorithm is to repeatedly apply a specific unitary transformation, known as the Grover operator, to a quantum state initialized in an equal superposition of all possible solutions. This operator consists of two main components: an oracle that marks the correct solution by inverting its sign, and a diffusion operator that amplifies the amplitude of the marked state. By applying the Grover operator a sufficient number of times, the amplitudes of the incorrect solutions are effectively suppressed, while the amplitude of the correct solution is significantly enhanced, allowing for the successful retrieval of the solution with high probability upon measuring the final quantum state.

\subsection{Maximum k-Cut Problem}

The Maximum k-Cut problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that requires partitioning the vertices of a graph into k disjoint sets to maximize the sum of the weights of the edges crossing different sets. Formally, given a weighted, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, where each edge $e \in E$ is assigned a non-negative weight $w(e)$, the goal is to find a partition $\mathcal{P} = \{S_1, S_2, \dots, S_k\}$ of the vertices, such that:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{k} \sum_{u \in S_i, v \in S_j} w(u, v) = \max_{\mathcal{P'}} \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{k} \sum_{u \in S_i, v \in S_j} w(u, v),
\label{eq:max_k_cut}
\end{equation}

where $w(u, v)$ denotes the weight of the edge connecting vertices $u$ and $v$, and the maximum is taken over all possible partitions of the vertices.

\section{Proposed Quantum Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we present our proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Maximum k-Cut problem using Grover's algorithm. The algorithm consists of the following main steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize the quantum state in an equal superposition of all possible partitions of the vertices.
    \item Define an oracle that marks the partitions with a sum of edge weights above a certain threshold.
    \item Apply the Grover operator a sufficient number of times to amplify the amplitude of the marked partitions.
    \item Measure the final quantum state to obtain a partition with a high sum of edge weights.
\end{enumerate}

In the following subsections, we provide a detailed description of each step of the algorithm and analyze its computational complexity.

\subsection{State Initialization}

To initialize the quantum state, we first encode each partition of the vertices into a binary string of length $n \log_2 k$, where $n = |V|$ is the number of vertices in the graph. This is done by assigning an integer label from the set $\{0, 1, \dots, k-1\}$ to each vertex, indicating its corresponding set in the partition. Next, we prepare a register of $n \log_2 k$ qubits in an equal superposition of all possible binary strings, which can be achieved by applying Hadamard gates to each qubit in the initial state $\ket{0}^{n \log_2 k}$:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi_0} = H^{n \log_2 k} \ket{0}^{n \log_2 k} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \ket{x},
\label{eq:initial_state}
\end{equation}

where $N = k^n$ is the total number of possible partitions, and $H$ denotes the Hadamard gate.

\subsection{Oracle Definition}

The oracle is designed to mark the partitions with a sum of edge weights above a certain threshold $T$. This can be achieved by applying a controlled phase gate to the quantum state, conditioned on the binary representation of the partition and the edge weights of the graph. Since the graph is generally sparse, the oracle can be implemented using a combination of quantum arithmetic circuits and efficient graph traversal techniques, such

\section{Representation of R0 and R1}

In the given ARM assembly code for the Maximum k-Cut problem, the registers R0 and R1 are used to store the values that represent the number of nodes (n) and the number of colors (k) available for the problem, respectively. The Maximum k-Cut problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem in graph theory, where the objective is to partition the nodes of an undirected graph into k non-empty subsets, such that the sum of the weights of the edges crossing between different subsets is maximized.

The values stored in R0 and R1 are assumed to be fixed and cannot be changed during the execution of the program. The choice of these registers to store n and k is arbitrary but serves as a convenient starting point for the algorithm.

\section{Algorithm Explanation}

The ARM assembly code provided is designed to efficiently determine if the given values of n and k are a valid solution to the Maximum k-Cut problem without using loops, branches, or labels. The algorithm performs this task using only the allowed instructions, adhering to the constraints imposed.

\subsection{Copying Values to Working Registers}

First, the values of n and k stored in R0 and R1 are copied into the working registers R2 and R3, respectively. This is done using the MOV instruction:

\begin{verbatim}
MOV R2, R0
MOV R3, R1
\end{verbatim}

This step ensures that the original values of n and k remain unchanged, as required by the problem constraints.

\subsection{Checking Validity of n and k}

Next, the algorithm checks if the values of n and k satisfy the necessary conditions for a valid Maximum k-Cut solution. Two conditions must be met for this problem: (1) n must be greater than or equal to k, and (2) k must be less than or equal to the largest allowed number (in this case, 3).

To check if n is greater than or equal to k, the SUB instruction is used:

\begin{verbatim}
SUB R4, R2, R3
\end{verbatim}

This instruction subtracts the value of R3 (k) from R2 (n) and stores the result in R4. If n is greater than or equal to k, the result will be positive or zero. Otherwise, the result will be negative.

Similarly, to check if k is less than or equal to the largest allowed number (3), the SUB instruction is used once again:

\begin{verbatim}
SUB R5, R3, #3
\end{verbatim}

This instruction subtracts the immediate value 3 from R3 (k) and stores the result in R5. If k is less than or equal to 3, the result will be non-positive.

\subsection{Setting the ZERO Flag}

Finally, the algorithm sets the ZERO flag in the processor status register (PSR) based on the outcome of the previous checks. This flag will be set to 1 if both conditions are met, and 0 otherwise.

To determine if both conditions are satisfied, the TST instruction is used to perform a bitwise AND operation on the results stored in R4 and R5:

\begin{verbatim}
TST R4, R5
\end{verbatim}

The ZERO flag will be set based on the outcome of this bitwise AND operation. If R4 and R5 both contain non-negative values (indicating that both conditions are met), the result will be non-negative, and the ZERO flag will be set to 1. If either R4 or R5 contains a negative value (indicating that at least one condition is not met), the result will be negative, and the ZERO flag will be set to 0.

This efficient algorithm effectively determines the validity of the given values of n and k for the Maximum k-Cut problem without violating the imposed constraints.
