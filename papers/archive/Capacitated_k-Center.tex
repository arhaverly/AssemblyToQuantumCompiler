\section{Introduction}

The Capacitated $k$-Center problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem that arises in various applications, such as facility location, clustering, and transportation planning. The problem can be formally defined as follows: Given a set of $n$ clients, a set of $m$ potential center locations, and a positive integer $k$, the goal is to select $k$ center locations and assign each client to a center in such a way that the maximum demand of any center does not exceed its capacity and the total assignment cost is minimized. The assignment cost is typically measured as the distance between a client and its assigned center. The Capacitated $k$-Center problem is NP-hard, which implies that finding an optimal solution is computationally challenging.

Classical algorithms for solving the Capacitated $k$-Center problem typically rely on heuristics or approximation techniques, given the inherent complexity of the problem. These approaches, while effective in providing near-optimal solutions, are often computationally expensive, particularly for large-scale problem instances. The emergence of quantum computing presents an opportunity to explore alternative techniques for solving the Capacitated $k$-Center problem that could potentially offer significant speedup over classical methods.

Grover's Algorithm, introduced by Lov Grover in 1996, is a quantum search algorithm that enables efficient search in an unstructured database. Grover's Algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms, with a complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$ for searching an unstructured database of size $N$. The algorithm's core idea is to amplify the amplitude of the desired state in a superposition of all possible states, thereby increasing the probability of measuring the desired state. Grover's Algorithm has been successfully applied to various problems, such as combinatorial search, satisfiability, and optimization.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the Capacitated $k$-Center problem using Grover's Algorithm. We propose a detailed algorithm that leverages the inherent speedup of Grover's Algorithm for unstructured search to significantly reduce the computational time required to find an optimal solution. Our approach extends the applicability of quantum computing techniques to combinatorial optimization problems and paves the way for future research in this area.

\section{Problem Definition}

In the Capacitated k-Center problem, we are given a set of clients, a set of potential center locations, and a capacity constraint for each center. The goal is to open k centers, assign each client to one center such that the capacity constraint is not violated, and minimize the maximum distance between a client and its assigned center. In our specific example, we are considering the case where the maximum number of centers is 3. The values in R0 and R1 represent the number of centers opened and the capacity of each center, respectively. 

\section{Algorithm Description}

Our algorithm aims to check if the given values of R0 and R1 form a valid solution for the Capacitated k-Center problem. We use ARM assembly code to accomplish this task while adhering to a set of constraints such as not using certain instructions, each register only being used once, and not allowing branches or loops. The algorithm checks the validity of the solution by testing if the values in R0 and R1 correspond to one of the valid solution combinations, and then setting the ZERO PSR flag accordingly.

\subsection{Valid Solution Combinations}

In this example, we consider the following valid combinations of R0 (number of centers) and R1 (capacity of each center):

\begin{itemize}
    \item R0 = 1 and R1 = 3
    \item R0 = 2 and R1 = 2
    \item R0 = 3 and R1 = 1
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Checking Conditions}

The ARM assembly code checks each of the three valid combinations separately. For each case, we first compare the value in R0 to the desired value, and then use the TEQ instruction to test if the value in R1 is equal to the corresponding capacity value. The result of this test is used to update a new register with either 0xFFFFFFFF (true) or 0 (false), depending on whether the current pair of values in R0 and R1 satisfies the condition.

\subsection{Combining Results}

After checking each of the three valid combinations, we use the AND and EOR instructions to combine the results stored in the three new registers. This is done by applying the AND instruction on the first two registers, and then using the EOR instruction to combine the result with the third register. The final result will be stored in another register, R10.

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

Finally, we set the ZERO PSR flag according to the value in R10. If R10 is 0, indicating that the values in R0 and R1 correspond to a valid solution, the ZERO PSR flag is set to 1. Otherwise, it remains unset. This flag can be used by other parts of the program to determine if the given values of R0 and R1 form a valid solution to the Capacitated k-Center problem.

\section{Efficiency Considerations}

The algorithm has been designed to minimize the use of resources and instructions, as the computer running the program is very limited. By avoiding branches, loops, and certain instructions, we ensure that the code executes efficiently on the ARM processor. Furthermore, the use of registers has been optimized to avoid double usage and meet the given constraints.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to solve the Capacitated $k$-Center problem using Grover's quantum search algorithm. Our proposed algorithm leverages the inherent speedup of Grover's Algorithm for unstructured search, which has the potential to significantly reduce the computational time required to find an optimal solution. By extending the applicability of quantum computing techniques to combinatorial optimization problems, we have contributed to the ongoing research in the field of quantum computing and its potential applications.

While our findings demonstrate the promise of quantum computing techniques for solving real-world optimization problems with large-scale data sets, further research is required to fully realize the potential of quantum computing in tackling complex problems in various domains. Future research directions include refining and optimizing our proposed algorithm, exploring the use of other quantum algorithms for solving the Capacitated $k$-Center problem, and investigating the application of quantum computing techniques to other combinatorial optimization problems.

As quantum computing technology continues to advance, we anticipate that it will play an increasingly important role in addressing complex optimization problems in various fields, including facility location, clustering, and transportation planning. Our work serves as a stepping stone towards harnessing the power of quantum computing for solving challenging optimization problems and ultimately improving decision-making processes in a wide range of applications.
