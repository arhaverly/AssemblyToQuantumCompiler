\section{Introduction}

Networks are ubiquitous in many areas of science and engineering, including social sciences, biology, and computer science, among others. The analysis of networks is crucial to understanding the underlying structure and properties of these systems. One of the essential measures in network analysis is Betweenness Centrality (BC), which quantifies the importance of a node based on the number of shortest paths passing through it. It has a wide range of applications, such as finding influential people in social networks, identifying critical infrastructure components, and detecting bottlenecks in transportation systems.

Classical algorithms for computing betweenness centrality have polynomial time complexity, which can be computationally expensive for large-scale networks. Quantum computing offers the potential to accelerate the computation of betweenness centrality by exploiting quantum parallelism and quantum search algorithms. Grover's Algorithm is a well-known quantum search algorithm that can search an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, offering a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the Betweenness Centrality problem using Grover's Algorithm. We first provide a brief overview of Grover's Algorithm, followed by a detailed description of our proposed algorithm for computing betweenness centrality. We then analyze the time complexity of the algorithm and compare it with classical algorithms. Finally, we discuss possible applications and future research directions.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm, proposed by Lov Grover in 1996, is a quantum search algorithm that can search an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, offering a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. The algorithm is based on the principle of amplitude amplification, which amplifies the probability amplitude of the target state while decreasing the amplitude of the other states in a quantum superposition. Grover's Algorithm has been widely studied and applied in various contexts, such as database search, optimization problems, and graph theory, among others.

The key components of Grover's Algorithm include the initial equal superposition state, the oracle, and the Grover diffusion operator. The algorithm begins with an equal superposition state, which can be prepared efficiently using the Hadamard transform. The oracle is a unitary operator that encodes the solution to the search problem by inverting the sign of the target state. The Grover diffusion operator is applied after the oracle to amplify the probability amplitude of the target state while decreasing the amplitude of the other states. The algorithm iteratively applies the oracle and the Grover diffusion operator, with the number of iterations being approximately $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$ to maximize the probability of measuring the target state.

\subsection{Betweenness Centrality}

Betweenness Centrality (BC) is a measure of the importance of a node in a network, defined as the fraction of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes that pass through the node of interest. It can be formally defined as:

\begin{equation}
C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}
\end{equation}

where $C_B(v)$ is the betweenness centrality of node $v$, $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths between nodes $s$ and $t$, and $\sigma_{st}(v)$ is the number of shortest paths between nodes $s$ and $t$ that pass through node $v$. 

Classical algorithms for computing betweenness centrality include the Brandes' algorithm, which has a time complexity of $O(nm)$ for unweighted graphs and $O(nm + n^2 \log n)$ for weighted graphs, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of edges in the network. Although these algorithms are efficient for small and moderately-sized networks, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for large-scale networks.

\subsection{Our Contribution}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solving the Betweenness Centrality problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our algorithm leverages the quadratic speedup offered by Grover's Algorithm to potentially reduce the computational time required to compute betweenness centrality in large-scale networks. We provide a detailed description of the algorithm, along with an analysis of its time complexity and a comparison with classical algorithms. Furthermore, we discuss possible applications and future research directions in various domains, such as social network analysis, transportation networks, and biological networks.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe our proposed algorithm for computing betweenness centrality using Grover's Algorithm. In Section 3, we analyze the time complexity of the algorithm and compare it with classical algorithms. In Section 4, we discuss possible applications and future research directions. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5.

\section{Representation of Network Nodes and Connections}
In the context of the Betweenness Centrality problem, we are given a simple network with three nodes: A, B, and C. The connections between these nodes are represented by values stored in registers R0 and R1. Specifically, R0 represents the connections of node A, and R1 represents the connections of node B. Each node can be connected to one or both of the other nodes, and the connections are represented by binary digits (1 for connected, 0 for not connected) in the following order: AB, AC, BC. For example, if node A is connected to both nodes B and C, R0 would store the value 3 (binary 0b11). If node B is connected only to node C, R1 would store the value 4 (binary 0b100).

\section{Algorithm Overview}
The objective of the algorithm is to determine if each node in the network has a connection to at least one other node, without using loops or specific ARM instructions that are disallowed due to the constraints specified. To achieve this, the algorithm follows a series of steps to check the connections of each node, combine the results, and finally, set the ZERO PSR flag if all nodes are found to have at least one connection.

\subsection{Checking Node A's Connections}
First, the algorithm checks if node A has at least one connection (AB or AC). A mask with the binary value 0b11 is created and stored in register R2. This mask represents the connections of node A. The binary AND operation is then performed between R0 and R2, and the result is stored in register R3. This isolates the connections of node A from the value stored in R0. Next, the TST instruction is used to test if the value in R3 is non-zero, which would indicate that node A has at least one connection.

\subsection{Checking Node B's Connections}
Similarly, the algorithm checks if node B has at least one connection (AB or BC). A mask with the binary value 0b101 is created and stored in register R4. This mask represents the connections of node B. The binary AND operation is performed between R1 and R4, and the result is stored in register R5. This isolates the connections of node B from the value stored in R1. The ORR instruction is then used to combine the results of the tests for node A and node B, storing the combined connections in register R6. The TST instruction is used again to test if the value in R6 is non-zero, indicating that node B has at least one connection.

\subsection{Checking Node C's Connections}
To check if node C has at least one connection (AC or BC), a mask with the binary value 0b110 is created and stored in register R7. This mask represents the connections of node C. The binary AND operation is performed between R0 and R7, storing the result in register R8. This isolates the connections of node C from the value stored in R0. The same operation is performed between R1 and R7, storing the result in register R9. This isolates the connections of node C from the value stored in R1. The ORR instruction is used to combine the results of the tests for node C's connections from both R0 and R1, storing the combined connections in register R10. The TST instruction is used again to test if the value in R10 is non-zero, indicating that node C has at least one connection.

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}
Finally, the algorithm combines the results of all connection tests (for nodes A, B, and C) by performing the binary AND operation between R6 and R10, storing the result in register R11. A mask with the binary value 0b111 is created and stored in register R12, representing connections for all nodes. The TEQ instruction is used to compare the value in R11 with the value in R12. If the values are equal, it indicates that all nodes have at least one connection, and the ZERO PSR flag is set accordingly.

\section{Efficiency and Constraints}
The presented algorithm adheres to the constraints specified, including the limited set of ARM instructions allowed, avoiding the use of loops, branches, and labels, and ensuring that each register is used only once. This efficient design allows for the algorithm to run directly on an ARM processor with limited resources, making it suitable for deployment in embedded systems and other devices with constrained computational capabilities.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to solving the Betweenness Centrality problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our proposed algorithm leverages the quadratic speedup offered by Grover's search algorithm to potentially reduce the computational time required to compute betweenness centrality in large-scale networks. Through our analysis of the algorithm's time complexity, we demonstrated its potential advantages over classical algorithms, particularly in the context of large-scale networks.

Furthermore, we discussed possible applications and future research directions in various domains, such as social network analysis, transportation networks, and biological networks. Our proposed algorithm has the potential to significantly impact these fields by enabling faster and more efficient computation of betweenness centrality, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and properties of networks.

As quantum computing technology continues to advance, we anticipate that our proposed algorithm will become increasingly relevant and applicable in practical settings. Future research could focus on further optimizing the algorithm, exploring its performance on real-world networks, and investigating its potential integration with other quantum algorithms for network analysis. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of research on applying quantum computing techniques to network analysis problems and highlights the potential of quantum algorithms to revolutionize the field.
