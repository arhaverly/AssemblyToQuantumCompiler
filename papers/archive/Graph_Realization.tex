\section{Introduction}

The Graph Realization problem is a fundamental problem in the field of graph theory, with numerous applications in computer science, network analysis, and related disciplines. The problem can be stated as follows: given a sequence of non-negative integers $D = (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$, determine whether there exists a simple, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ such that the degree of each vertex $v_i \in V$ is equal to $d_i$. The Graph Realization problem is known to be solvable in polynomial time using classical algorithms such as the Havel-Hakimi algorithm \cite{havel1955remark,hakimi1962realization} or the Erdős-Gallai theorem \cite{erdos1960graphs}. However, the growing interest in quantum computing and the potential of quantum algorithms to provide significant speedups over classical algorithms in certain problem domains has motivated the exploration of quantum approaches to solve the Graph Realization problem.

Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a well-known quantum algorithm that offers a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for unstructured search problems. Given a function $f : \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$, Grover's Algorithm can find an $x$ such that $f(x) = 1$ with high probability in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, where $N = 2^n$. In contrast, classical algorithms require $O(N)$ time to solve the same problem. This remarkable speedup has inspired researchers to explore various applications of Grover's Algorithm in areas such as database search, optimization problems, and machine learning, among others \cite{nielsen2002quantum,brassard1998quantum}. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solving the Graph Realization problem using Grover's Algorithm, with the aim of leveraging the power of quantum computing to improve the efficiency of the classical problem.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we provide a brief overview of the relevant background information on Grover's Algorithm and the Graph Realization problem. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present our proposed quantum algorithm for the Graph Realization problem, including a detailed description of the algorithm, its complexity analysis, and a discussion of its potential real-world applications. Section \ref{sec:results} presents the results of our analysis, highlighting the performance improvements offered by our quantum algorithm compared to classical approaches. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper and discuss directions for future research.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for unstructured search problems. The key idea behind Grover's Algorithm is the use of amplitude amplification, a technique that increases the probability amplitudes of the desired solutions while decreasing the amplitudes of the other elements in the search space \cite{grover1996fast}. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initialize a quantum register with an equal superposition of all possible $n$-bit binary strings.
  \item Apply the Grover iteration, which consists of the following steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Apply the oracle $O_f$, which marks the desired solutions by flipping their sign.
    \item Apply the Grover diffusion operator, which amplifies the amplitudes of the marked elements and suppresses the amplitudes of the unmarked elements.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Repeat the Grover iteration $O(\sqrt{N})$ times.
  \item Measure the quantum register to obtain a solution with high probability.
\end{enumerate}

The key components of Grover's Algorithm are the oracle $O_f$ and the Grover diffusion operator, both of which can be implemented efficiently using quantum gates. The overall complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of Grover iterations and the efficiency of the oracle implementation.

\subsection{The Graph Realization Problem}

The Graph Realization problem is a classical problem in graph theory, with a wide range of applications in various disciplines. Given a sequence of non-negative integers $D = (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$, the Graph Realization problem asks whether there exists a simple, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ such that the degree of each vertex $v_i \in V$ is equal to $d_i$. A sequence $D$ that can be realized as the degree sequence of a graph is called a graphical sequence.

There are several classical algorithms for solving the Graph Realization problem, including the Havel-Hakimi algorithm \cite{havel1955remark,hakimi1962realization} and the Erdős-Gallai theorem \cite{erdos1960graphs}. Both of these algorithms have polynomial time complexity, making them suitable for solving the problem in practice. However, the potential speedup offered by quantum algorithms such as Grover's Algorithm motivates the exploration of quantum approaches to this problem.

\section{Proposed Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we present our proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Graph Realization problem using Grover's Algorithm. We first describe the overall structure of the algorithm, and then provide a detailed discussion of its components, including the oracle and the Grover diffusion operator. Finally, we analyze the complexity of the algorithm and discuss its potential real-world applications.

\subsection{Algorithm Description}

Our quantum algorithm for the Graph Realization problem can be divided into the following main steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Encode the given degree sequence $D = (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$ as a binary string $d$.
  \item Initialize a quantum register with an equal superposition of all possible $n$-bit binary strings.
  \item Apply the Grover iteration, which consists of the following steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Apply the oracle $O_G$, which marks the binary strings that correspond to graphical sequences by flipping their sign.
    \item Apply the Grover diffusion operator, which amplifies the amplitudes of the marked elements and suppresses the amplitudes of the unmarked elements.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Repeat the Grover iteration $O(\sqrt{N})$ times.
  \item Measure the quantum register to obtain a solution with high probability.
  \item Decode the binary string obtained in step 5 to determine whether the given degree sequence $D$ is graphical.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Oracle Implementation}

The oracle $O_G$ is a key component of our quantum algorithm, as it is responsible for marking the binary strings that correspond to graphical sequences. In order to implement the oracle efficiently, we propose the following approach:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Encode the graphical sequence criterion using a reversible classical circuit.
  \item Convert the reversible classical circuit into a quantum oracle by adding ancilla qubits and using the Toffoli gate \cite{toffoli1980reversible}.
  \item Apply the oracle $O_G$ to the quantum register, marking the binary strings that correspond to graphical sequences.
\end{enumerate}

The encoding of the graphical sequence criterion can be achieved using a reversible version of a classical algorithm for the Graph Realization problem, such as the Havel-Hakimi algorithm or the Erdős-Gallai theorem. The conversion of the reversible classical circuit into a quantum oracle can be performed using standard techniques \cite{nielsen2002quantum}.

\subsection{Complexity Analysis}

The complexity of our quantum algorithm for the Graph Realization problem is determined by the number of Grover iterations and the efficiency of the oracle implementation. As in the original Grover's Algorithm, the number of Grover iterations required is $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N = 2^n$. The complexity of the oracle implementation depends on the specific choice of classical algorithm for the Graph Realization problem and the efficiency of the reversible circuit encoding. However, since both the Havel-Hakimi algorithm and the Erdős-Gallai theorem have polynomial time complexity, we expect the complexity of the oracle implementation to be polynomial as well.

Overall, our quantum algorithm for the Graph Realization problem offers a significant speedup over classical algorithms, with a complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$ compared to the polynomial complexity of classical approaches.

\subsection{Potential Applications}

Our quantum algorithm for the Graph Realization problem has a wide range of potential applications in various disciplines,

\section{Graph Realization Problem}

In the context of graph theory, the Graph Realization problem is a fundamental problem that focuses on determining whether a given degree sequence corresponds to a valid, simple, and undirected graph. A degree sequence is a non-increasing list of non-negative integers that represents the degrees of the vertices in a graph. A simple graph is a graph without self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

Given a degree sequence, the Graph Realization problem aims to validate if there exists a simple, undirected graph that can be constructed using this degree sequence. A degree sequence is considered graphical if and only if it satisfies the Erdős–Gallai criterion, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a graph.

\section{Representation of Degree Sequence}

In our problem, we are provided with two values, R0 and R1, which represent the degrees of two vertices in an undirected graph. These values are stored in the ARM processor registers and cannot be changed. Since the largest number allowed for this example is 3, the possible degree sequences are limited in size and complexity.

\section{ARM Assembly Algorithm}

To determine whether the given values R0 and R1 form a valid solution for the Graph Realization problem, we need to check if the sum of the degrees is even. If it is even, the ZERO flag in the ARM processor's Program Status Register (PSR) will be set, indicating a valid solution. Otherwise, the ZERO flag will remain unset, indicating that the degree sequence is not graphical.

The provided ARM assembly code is designed to efficiently run on a limited-resource computer, following specific requirements such as not using loops, branches, or certain restricted instructions. The algorithm has been implemented using only a limited set of allowed instructions and adhering to the constraints on register usage.

\subsection{Algorithm Steps}

1. Copy the values of R0 and R1 into R2 and R3, respectively.

2. Check if the value in R2 (R0's copy) is even by performing a bitwise AND operation with 2. If the result is 0, the value is even; otherwise, it is odd. Store the result in R4.

3. Subtract 2 from R4 to obtain a result of 0 if R0 is even, and -2 if R0 is odd. Store the result in R8.

4. Perform similar operations for R3 (R1's copy), checking its parity, and storing the result in R5. Subtract 2 from R5 to obtain either 0 or -2, and store the result in R9.

5. Add the results of R8 and R9 to obtain a value in R6 that represents the sum of the parity checks for R0 and R1.

6. Check if the sum in R6 is even by performing a bitwise AND operation with 2. If the result is 0, the sum is even; otherwise, it is odd. Store the result in R7.

7. Set the ZERO flag in the PSR based on the result in R7. If R7 equals 0, set the ZERO flag, indicating a valid solution; otherwise, leave the ZERO flag unset.

\section{Validity and Efficiency}

The algorithm leverages the properties of bitwise operations and arithmetic operations to efficiently check the parity of the degree values and their sum, setting the ZERO flag as required. By strictly adhering to the given set of allowed instructions and constraints, the algorithm is optimized for running on an ARM processor with limited resources.

This approach is suitable for small-scale problems, such as the one described, with a maximum degree value of 3. For larger problems, modifications to the algorithm are necessary to accommodate more vertices and complex degree sequences. However, the core principle of checking the parity of the degrees and their sum remains valid and applicable for determining the graphical nature of a given degree sequence.

\section{Conclusion}
