\section{Introduction}

The Minimum Clique Cover (MCC) problem is an important combinatorial optimization problem with wide-ranging applications in various fields such as social network analysis, information retrieval, and bioinformatics \cite{garey1979computers}. The problem can be formally stated as follows: given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the objective is to partition the vertices $V$ into the smallest possible number of cliques, where a clique is a complete subgraph of $G$. The MCC problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{garey1979computers}, which makes it computationally challenging to solve for large-scale instances.

Classical algorithms for solving the MCC problem, such as the greedy algorithm and integer linear programming, suffer from exponential time complexity in the worst case. This limitation has fueled research into alternative approaches, such as using quantum computing techniques, which have the potential to provide significant speedups over classical methods \cite{nielsen2002quantum}.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the MCC problem using Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast}, a well-known quantum search algorithm that has been proven to provide a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. Grover's Algorithm is particularly suited for solving unstructured search problems, where the objective is to find a specific item within an unsorted database. By formulating the MCC problem as an unstructured search problem and applying Grover's Algorithm, we are able to potentially achieve a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms.

The primary contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A detailed description of our approach to solving the MCC problem using Grover's Algorithm, including the necessary quantum circuits and oracles.
\item An analysis of the theoretical complexity and performance of our proposed algorithm, with comparisons to classical methods.
\item A discussion of the potential advantages and limitations of using quantum computing techniques for combinatorial optimization problems, as well as the implications for future research in the field.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief overview of Grover's Algorithm and its applications in quantum computing. Section III describes our approach to solving the MCC problem using Grover's Algorithm, including the necessary quantum circuits and oracles. Section IV presents an analysis of the theoretical complexity and performance of our proposed algorithm, with comparisons to classical methods. Section V discusses the potential advantages and limitations of using quantum computing techniques for combinatorial optimization problems, as well as the implications for future research in the field. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and highlights possible directions for future work.

\section{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that was introduced by Lov Grover in 1996 \cite{grover1996fast}. The algorithm is designed to search an unsorted database of $N$ items for a specific target item, with a success probability of at least $\frac{1}{2}$, in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps. This represents a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms, which require $O(N)$ steps in the worst case.

The key insight behind Grover's Algorithm is the use of quantum parallelism and amplitude amplification to significantly reduce the number of iterations required to find the target item. The algorithm leverages the property of quantum superposition to simultaneously search multiple items in the database, while the amplitude amplification technique iteratively increases the probability amplitudes of the target item, making it more likely to be found in subsequent measurements.

Grover's Algorithm has been extensively studied and applied to various problems in quantum computing, such as database search, function inversion, and optimization problems \cite{nielsen2002quantum, boyer1998tight}. In the context of combinatorial optimization problems, Grover's Algorithm can be applied to solve problems that can be formulated as unstructured search problems, where the objective is to find a specific item within an unsorted database.

In the following sections, we will describe our approach to solving the MCC problem using Grover's Algorithm, including the necessary quantum circuits and oracles, as well as an analysis of the theoretical complexity and performance of our proposed algorithm.

\section{Minimum Clique Cover Problem Representation}

In the context of this ARM assembly code implementation, the values in registers R0 and R1 are used to represent the number of vertices in two disjoint cliques in a graph. A clique is a subgraph of an undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. The Minimum Clique Cover problem aims to partition the vertices of a graph into the smallest number of cliques possible.

\section{Graph Representation and Constraints}

Given the constraints of the problem, the largest number allowed in this particular example is 3. This means that the graph can have at most three vertices. Therefore, the possible values for R0 and R1 are integers in the range of 0 to 3, inclusive. The ARM assembly code is designed to check whether the values stored in R0 and R1 provide a valid solution to the Minimum Clique Cover problem under these constraints.

\section{Algorithm Description}

The ARM assembly code implementation presented in this paper follows a simple, yet efficient algorithm to decide whether the values in R0 and R1 correspond to a valid solution to the Minimum Clique Cover problem. The algorithm comprises the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add the values in R0 and R1, and store the result in a new register, R2. The value in R2 represents the total number of vertices in the two disjoint cliques.
    \item Subtract the largest allowed number (3) from the value in R2, and store the result in another register, R3. This operation determines whether the number of vertices in the two cliques exceeds the maximum allowed value.
    \item Compare the value in R3 with 0. If R3 is less than or equal to 0, it implies that the sum of the vertices in the two cliques is less than or equal to the largest allowed number, which means that the solution is valid. In this case, the ZERO flag in the Program Status Register (PSR) is set. Otherwise, the ZERO flag is cleared to indicate an invalid solution.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Efficiency Considerations}

The ARM assembly code has been designed to be efficient in terms of both execution time and resource utilization. The code does not use any loops, branches, or labels, and relies solely on arithmetic and comparison instructions. This ensures a fast execution time and minimal overhead in terms of instruction decoding and fetch operations. Moreover, the code adheres to the constraints of using each register only once and not using a register twice in a single instruction.

Additionally, the algorithm is highly efficient in terms of the number of instructions executed. The code consists of only three instructions, which are executed sequentially, and there is no need for any branching or looping. This allows the processor to execute the code quickly and with minimal power consumption. Furthermore, the use of a small number of registers reduces the complexity of register allocation and management, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the code.

\section{Use in a PhD Research Paper}

This ARM assembly code implementation and the accompanying algorithm description can be readily incorporated into a PhD research paper that investigates the Minimum Clique Cover problem and its efficient solutions. The code and explanation provided in this paper can serve as a concise example of how the problem can be represented and solved using low-level programming techniques and minimal computing resources.

By discussing the efficiency considerations and the rationale behind the choice of instructions and registers, the paper can shed light on the challenges and trade-offs involved in designing efficient algorithms for solving complex problems on resource-constrained hardware platforms. Moreover, the paper can also serve as a starting point for exploring more advanced techniques and optimizations that can further improve the performance and efficiency of solving the Minimum Clique Cover problem on ARM processors and other low-power computing platforms.
