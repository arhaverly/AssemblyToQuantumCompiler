\section{Introduction}

The Independent Dominating Set (IDS) problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that has been widely studied in various fields due to its numerous applications. In graph theory, an independent dominating set is a subset $D$ of vertices in a graph $G = (V, E)$ such that every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$, and no two vertices in $D$ are adjacent. The IDS problem aims to find the smallest independent dominating set in a given graph. This problem arises in various practical applications, including network design, social network analysis, and bioinformatics \cite{Haynes1998, Garey1979}. Unfortunately, the IDS problem is NP-hard \cite{Garey1979}, which makes it computationally expensive to solve using classical algorithms.

Quantum computing has been demonstrated as a promising avenue for solving problems that are intractable using classical methods. Grover's algorithm \cite{Grover1996}, in particular, is a quantum search algorithm that can find an item in an unsorted database with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. This speedup has been extended to a range of optimization and decision problems \cite{Durr1996, Montanaro2015}. In this paper, we explore the application of Grover's algorithm to solve the Independent Dominating Set problem.

Our contributions are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We present a novel application of Grover's algorithm for solving the IDS problem, taking advantage of the quadratic speedup provided by quantum computing.
    \item We design a Quantum Oracle that efficiently recognizes independent dominating sets and encodes the problem's constraints into a quantum circuit.
    \item We analyze the computational complexity of our proposed approach and demonstrate its potential for solving larger instances of the IDS problem in practical timeframes.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:background} provides background information on the Independent Dominating Set problem, Grover's algorithm, and Quantum Oracles. Section \ref{sec:approach} details our proposed approach to solving the IDS problem using Grover's algorithm, including the design of the Quantum Oracle. Section \ref{sec:complexity} analyzes the computational complexity of our approach. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and outlines potential future work.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Independent Dominating Set Problem}

The Independent Dominating Set problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem. Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, an independent dominating set is a subset $D \subseteq V$ such that every vertex $v \in V \setminus D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$, and no two vertices in $D$ are adjacent. The objective of the IDS problem is to find an independent dominating set $D$ of minimum cardinality.

The IDS problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{Garey1979}, which implies that there is no known algorithm that can solve it in polynomial time unless P=NP. Hence, solving the IDS problem using classical algorithms becomes computationally expensive, particularly for large graphs.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's algorithm \cite{Grover1996} is a quantum search algorithm that can find an item in an unsorted database quadratically faster than classical algorithms. Given a database of $N$ items, Grover's algorithm can find a marked item with high probability using only $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries to a Quantum Oracle, compared to the $O(N)$ queries required by classical algorithms.

Grover's algorithm has been extended to solve a variety of optimization and decision problems \cite{Durr1996, Montanaro2015}. The key to applying Grover's algorithm to such problems is the design of a suitable Quantum Oracle that encodes the problem's constraints.

\subsection{Quantum Oracles}

A Quantum Oracle is a black box that can recognize a solution to a particular problem. Given an input state, the Quantum Oracle flips the sign of the state if it corresponds to a solution and does nothing otherwise. Mathematically, a Quantum Oracle $U_f$ for a function $f(x)$ performs the following operation:

\begin{equation}
    U_f |x\rangle = (-1)^{f(x)} |x\rangle.
\end{equation}

When applying Grover's algorithm to optimization and decision problems, the Quantum Oracle recognizes the solutions that satisfy the problem's constraints.

\section{Proposed Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

In this section, we describe our proposed approach to solving the Independent Dominating Set problem using Grover's algorithm. We first present the encoding of the problem's constraints and then detail the design of the Quantum Oracle.

\subsection{Encoding the Independent Dominating Set Problem}

To apply Grover's algorithm to the IDS problem, we need to encode the problem's constraints into a quantum circuit. We represent each vertex $v_i \in V$ by a qubit $|q_i\rangle$. If $q_i = 1$, the corresponding vertex $v_i$ is included in the independent dominating set, and if $q_i = 0$, it is excluded.

The constraints of the IDS problem can be encoded as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each vertex $v_i \in V$ either belongs to the independent dominating set or has at least one neighbor in the set. This constraint can be encoded as a series of multi-controlled X-gates (also known as Toffoli gates) acting on the qubits corresponding to the vertex and its neighbors.
    \item No two vertices in the independent dominating set are adjacent. This constraint can be encoded using a multi-controlled X-gate acting on the qubits corresponding to adjacent vertices.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design of the Quantum Oracle}

The Quantum Oracle for the IDS problem must be able to recognize independent dominating sets and flip the sign of the corresponding input states. To achieve this, we design a quantum circuit that consists of two main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A constraint-checking circuit that verifies whether an input state satisfies the constraints of the IDS problem. The circuit is constructed using the encoding described in the previous subsection.
    \item An ancilla qubit initialized to $|-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)$, which is used to store the result of the constraint-checking circuit. If the input state satisfies the constraints, the ancilla qubit remains in the $|-\rangle$ state; otherwise, it is flipped to the $|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$ state.
\end{enumerate}

The Quantum Oracle is then implemented as a series of quantum gates that perform the following operations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Apply the constraint-checking circuit to the input state.
    \item Perform a controlled Z-gate between the ancilla qubit and a qubit representing the independent dominating set.
    \item Apply the inverse of the constraint-checking circuit to the input state.
\end{enumerate}

This design ensures that the Quantum Oracle flips the sign of the input state if and only if it corresponds to an independent dominating set.

\section{Computational Complexity}
\label{sec:complexity}

In this section, we analyze the computational complexity of our proposed approach for solving the Independent Dominating Set problem using Grover's algorithm. The complexity of our approach is determined by two factors: the complexity of the Quantum Oracle and the number of iterations required by Grover's algorithm.

The Quantum Oracle's complexity is dominated by the number of multi-controlled X-gates used to encode the problem's constraints. In the worst case, the number of such gates is proportional to the number of edges in the graph, $|E|$. Therefore, the complexity of the Quantum Oracle is $O(|E|)$.

The number of iterations required by Grover's algorithm for an unstructured search problem is $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the number of possible solutions. In the case of the IDS problem, there are $2^{|V|}$ possible subsets of vertices. Hence, the number of iterations is $O(\sqrt{2^{|V|}}) = O(2^{\frac{|V|}{2}})$.

Taking both factors into account, the overall computational complexity of our proposed approach is $O(|E| \cdot 2^{\frac{|V|}{2}})$. This represents a significant reduction in complexity compared to classical algorithms for

\section{Independent Dominating Set Problem Representation}

In the Independent Dominating Set (IDS) problem, we are given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. The objective is to find a minimal subset $D$ of vertices such that every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$, and no two vertices in $D$ are adjacent. This subset $D$ is called an independent dominating set of the graph.

For our specific implementation, we focus on the case where the graph has 3 vertices. We represent the dominating set $D$ using two registers, R0 and R1, in the ARM processor. Each register stores a binary number, where the $i$-th bit represents the inclusion of the vertex $i$ in the dominating set. For example, if R0 contains the decimal number 3 (11 in binary) and R1 contains the decimal number 2 (10 in binary), the dominating set $D$ consists of vertices 1 and 2, represented by the union of the binary numbers in R0 and R1.

\section{Algorithm for Independent Dominating Set Validation}

Our algorithm checks if the given values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the IDS problem for a graph with 3 vertices. To achieve this, the algorithm performs the following steps:

\subsection{Bitwise OR operation}

The first step is to perform a bitwise OR operation on the values stored in R0 and R1. This operation is used to combine the sets represented by R0 and R1 to obtain the complete dominating set. The result of this operation is stored in register R2.

The bitwise OR operation is performed using the ORR instruction in ARM assembly. The instruction has the following format:

\begin{verbatim}
    ORR Rd, Rn, Rm
\end{verbatim}

where Rd is the destination register, Rn and Rm are the source registers, and the OR operation is performed between the values in Rn and Rm. In our case, Rn is R0, Rm is R1, and Rd is R2.

\subsection{Loading the largest possible value}

The second step is to load the largest possible value for a graph with 3 vertices into register R3. In our case, the largest possible value is 7 (111 in binary), as it represents the union of all vertices. This value is loaded into R3 using the MOV instruction, which has the following format:

\begin{verbatim}
    MOV Rd, #value
\end{verbatim}

where Rd is the destination register, and value is the immediate value to be loaded. In our case, Rd is R3, and the value is 7.

\subsection{Comparison and setting the ZERO flag}

The final step is to compare the values in registers R2 and R3. If these values are equal, it means that the union of the sets represented by R0 and R1 covers all vertices in the graph, and thus the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the IDS problem.

To perform the comparison, we use the CMP instruction, which has the following format:

\begin{verbatim}
    CMP Rn, Rm
\end{verbatim}

where Rn and Rm are the registers containing the values to be compared. In our case, Rn is R2, and Rm is R3. The CMP instruction updates the processor status register (PSR) flags based on the result of the comparison. Specifically, it sets the ZERO flag if the values in Rn and Rm are equal.

By checking the value of the ZERO flag after executing the algorithm, we can determine whether the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the IDS problem. If the ZERO flag is set to 1, the values in R0 and R1 are a solution; otherwise, if the ZERO flag is set to 0, they are not a solution.

In summary, our algorithm efficiently checks if the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Independent Dominating Set problem for a graph with 3 vertices. The algorithm adheres to the given restrictions and limitations, making it suitable for execution on an ARM processor with limited capabilities.
