\section{Introduction}

The minimum maximal matching problem (MMM) is an important combinatorial optimization problem that arises in many real-world applications, such as network design, data communication, and parallel computing. The primary objective of the MMM problem is to find a matching in a given graph such that the maximum size of the matched edges is minimized. This problem has significant implications in determining the optimal allocation of resources and minimizing the overall computational time in various scenarios.

Classical algorithms for solving the MMM problem, such as the Hungarian algorithm and Edmonds' algorithm, are based on the principles of linear programming, dynamic programming, or augmenting paths. However, these algorithms have exponential time complexity, making them inefficient for large-scale instances of the MMM problem. In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for solving computational problems that are intractable for classical computers. Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, have demonstrated significant speedups over classical algorithms for specific problems, including prime factorization and unstructured search.

Grover's algorithm, in particular, has been applied to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, graph coloring problem, and satisfiability problem. The key advantage of Grover's algorithm is its quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms, which is achieved by exploiting the superposition and interference properties of quantum states. In this paper, we extend the application of Grover's algorithm to solve the MMM problem, aiming to reduce the computational complexity and improve the efficiency compared to classical algorithms.

Our proposed quantum algorithm for the MMM problem consists of two main components: (i) encoding the MMM problem into a quantum oracle, and (ii) applying Grover's search algorithm to find the optimal solution. The quantum oracle is constructed by representing the graph and its matching constraints as a set of Boolean functions, which are then converted into quantum gates. Grover's search algorithm is employed to search the solution space, effectively exploiting the quantum interference property to amplify the probability of the optimal solution.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We present a novel quantum algorithm for solving the MMM problem based on Grover's algorithm, which significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to classical algorithms.
    \item We provide a detailed description of the quantum oracle construction, including the representation of the graph and matching constraints as Boolean functions and their conversion into quantum gates.
    \item We analyze the performance of our proposed quantum algorithm in terms of computational complexity and demonstrate its potential advantages over classical algorithms for large-scale MMM problems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Minimum Maximal Matching Problem}

The minimum maximal matching problem (MMM) is defined on an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. A matching $M$ is a subset of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex. The objective of the MMM problem is to find a matching $M$ that minimizes the maximum size of the matched edges, i.e., the largest number of edges incident to any vertex in the matching.

Formally, the MMM problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming problem as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& \text{minimize}
& & \max_{v \in V} \sum_{e \in E(v)} x_e \\
& \text{subject to}
& & x_e \in \{0, 1\}, \; e \in E \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $E(v)$ is the set of edges incident to vertex $v$, and $x_e$ is a binary variable that indicates whether edge $e$ is included in the matching $M$.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for unstructured search, which provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. Given an unsorted database of $N$ items and a target item that satisfies a specific property, Grover's algorithm can find the target item with a probability of at least $\frac{1}{2}$ using only $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries, compared to $O(N)$ queries required by classical algorithms.

The key components of Grover's algorithm include a quantum oracle, which encodes the target property, and Grover's iterate, which consists of a series of quantum operations that amplify the probability of the target item in the quantum state. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prepare an equal superposition of all possible items using the Hadamard transform: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \ket{i}$.
    \item Apply the quantum oracle to mark the target item by adding a negative phase: $O \ket{i} = (-1)^{f(i)} \ket{i}$, where $f(i) = 1$ if item $i$ is the target and $f(i) = 0$ otherwise.
    \item Perform Grover's iterate, which includes the following steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Apply the Hadamard transform to the marked quantum state.
        \item Apply a conditional phase shift, where all items except $\ket{0}$ receive a negative phase.
        \item Apply the Hadamard transform again to the shifted quantum state.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Repeat steps 2 and 3 for approximately $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$ iterations.
    \item Measure the final quantum state, which will yield the target item with a high probability.
\end{enumerate}

Grover's algorithm can be adapted to solve combinatorial optimization problems by encoding the problem constraints into the quantum oracle and searching for the optimal solution in the solution space.

\section{Quantum Algorithm for the MMM Problem}
\label{sec:quantum_algorithm}

In this section, we present our proposed quantum algorithm for the MMM problem, which consists of encoding the MMM problem into a quantum oracle and applying Grover's search algorithm to find the optimal solution.

\subsection{Quantum Oracle Construction}

The first step in our quantum algorithm is to construct a quantum oracle that encodes the MMM problem and its constraints. To achieve this, we represent the graph and the matching constraints as a set of Boolean functions, which are then converted into quantum gates. The Boolean functions can be defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For each edge $e \in E$, let $x_e$ be a binary variable that indicates whether edge $e$ is included in the matching $M$.
    \item For each vertex $v \in V$, let $S_v(x)$ be a Boolean function that evaluates to 1 if the sum of $x_e$ for all edges $e \in E(v)$ is at most the maximum size of the matched edges, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

The quantum oracle can be constructed by implementing these Boolean functions as quantum gates, which operate on the binary variables $x_e$ encoded in the quantum state. Specifically, the oracle can be designed as a sequence of multi-controlled Toffoli gates, which perform the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For each vertex $v \in V$, apply a multi-controlled Toffoli gate with the control qubits corresponding to the binary variables $x_e$ for all edges $e \in E(v)$ and the target qubit representing the Boolean function $S_v(x)$.
    \item Apply a multi-controlled Toffoli gate with the control qubits representing the Boolean functions $S_v(x)$ for all vertices $v \in V$ and the target qubit encoding the overall oracle function, which evaluates to 1 if all matching constraints are satisfied and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

The constructed quantum oracle can then be used in Grover's search algorithm to identify the optimal solution for the MMM problem.

\subsection{Application of Grover's Algorithm}

Once the quantum oracle for

\section{Minimum Maximal Matching Problem Representation}

In the Minimum Maximal Matching problem, the goal is to find a matching in a given graph such that the sum of the weights of the matched edges is maximized. In this particular case, we assume the graph is simple and unweighted, and we limit the size of the matching to two vertices. The values stored in registers R0 and R1 represent the indices of two vertices in the graph.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

Our proposed algorithm aims to determine whether the given pair of vertices, represented by the values in R0 and R1, forms a valid solution to the Minimum Maximal Matching problem. The algorithm checks if the sum of the values in R0 and R1 is greater than or equal to the largest allowed number (3, in this case). If the sum is greater than or equal to 3, the algorithm concludes that the given vertex pair forms a valid solution. Otherwise, the pair is deemed not to be a solution.

\section{ARM Assembly Code Analysis}

The ARM assembly code provided in this paper follows several constraints, such as the prohibition of certain instructions and loops. We will now explain each instruction in the code and describe its purpose in the algorithm.

\subsection{MOV R2, \#3}

This instruction loads the largest allowed number (3) into register R2. This value will be used later to compare with the sum of the values in R0 and R1.

\subsection{ADD R3, R0, R1}

This instruction adds the values of R0 and R1 and stores the result in register R3. The sum represents the combined indices of the two vertices in the graph.

\subsection{CMP R3, R2}

This instruction compares the sum stored in R3 (from the previous instruction) to the largest allowed number stored in R2. The comparison sets the appropriate flags in the processor status register based on the result.

\subsection{MVN R4, R2}

Since a register cannot be used twice in an instruction, we employ the MVN (Move Not) instruction to negate the value in R2 and store the result in register R4. This instruction will be used in conjunction with the CMN (Compare Negative) instruction to derive the final result.

\subsection{CMN R3, R4}

The CMN instruction effectively adds the values in R3 and R4 (the negated value of the largest allowed number) and sets the flags in the processor status register based on the result. In this case, the ZERO flag will be set to 1 if the sum of the values in R0 and R1 is greater than or equal to the largest allowed number. If the sum is less than the largest allowed number, the ZERO flag will be set to 0.

\section{Algorithm Efficiency}

The ARM assembly code presented in this paper is designed to be highly efficient, as it does not rely on loops or branches and adheres to the specified constraints. As a result, the algorithm can be executed directly on an ARM processor with a minimal number of instructions. The simplicity of the code ensures that the processor can evaluate the minimum maximal matching solution quickly and with minimal overhead.

\section{Conclusion}

In summary, the ARM assembly code provided in this paper demonstrates an efficient method for determining whether a pair of vertex indices, represented by the values in R0 and R1, forms a valid solution to the Minimum Maximal Matching problem. By adhering to the specified constraints and using a small set of instructions, the algorithm achieves high efficiency and can be executed directly on an ARM processor with minimal overhead. This approach can be particularly useful in resource-constrained environments where processor power and memory are limited.
