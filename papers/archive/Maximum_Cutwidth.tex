\section{Introduction}

Quantum computing, a promising paradigm shift in computer science, has received significant attention in recent years due to its potential to solve complex problems faster than classical computing \cite{nielsen_chuang_2010}. The unique principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, enable quantum computers to process information in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. This difference can be exploited to develop algorithms that offer substantial speedups over their classical counterparts.

One of the earliest and most well-known quantum algorithms is Grover's Algorithm, proposed by Lov Grover in 1996 \cite{grover1996fast}. Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that solves the unstructured search problem with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. While the algorithm's original purpose was to search an unsorted database, it has since been adapted to solve various optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Knapsack Problem \cite{zalka1999grover, montanaro2015quantum}.

The Maximum Cutwidth problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that arises in diverse fields, including VLSI design, network analysis, and scheduling \cite{garey_johnson_1979, monien1988maximum}. Given an undirected graph, the objective of the Maximum Cutwidth problem is to find a linear arrangement of the vertices that maximizes the number of edges crossing any vertical cut between consecutive vertices. This problem is NP-hard, making it an attractive candidate for quantum algorithm research \cite{karp1972reducibility}.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the Maximum Cutwidth problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our method encodes the Maximum Cutwidth problem into an appropriate format for Grover's Algorithm, allowing us to take advantage of the quantum speedup offered by the algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the complexity of our approach and compare its performance with classical algorithms.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:background} provides background information on Grover's Algorithm and the Maximum Cutwidth problem. Section \ref{sec:approach} describes our approach to solving the Maximum Cutwidth problem using Grover's Algorithm, while Section \ref{sec:analysis} presents an in-depth analysis of the complexity of our approach. Section \ref{sec:results} compares the performance of our method with classical algorithms, and Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper with a summary of our contributions and possible future research directions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
\label{subsec:grover}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for unstructured search problems \cite{grover1996fast}. The algorithm's primary component is the Grover iteration, which consists of an oracle and a diffusion operator. The oracle encodes the solution to the search problem, while the diffusion operator amplifies the probability of finding the desired solution. By applying the Grover iteration multiple times, the algorithm can efficiently locate the target solution.

The primary advantage of Grover's Algorithm is its ability to search an unsorted database of size $N$ with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$. This quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms has been proven to be optimal for quantum search algorithms \cite{bennett1997strengths}. However, Grover's Algorithm is not limited to searching databases; it can also be applied to solve various optimization problems by encoding the problem into a suitable oracle.

\subsection{Maximum Cutwidth Problem}
\label{subsec:max_cutwidth}

The Maximum Cutwidth problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding a linear arrangement of vertices in an undirected graph that maximizes the number of edges crossing any vertical cut between consecutive vertices \cite{garey_johnson_1979}. Formally, given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with vertex set $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ and edge set $E = \{e_1, e_2, \dots, e_m\}$, the Maximum Cutwidth problem seeks to find a permutation $\pi$ of the vertices such that the cutwidth $C(\pi)$ is maximized, where the cutwidth is defined as:

\begin{equation}
C(\pi) = \max_{1 \leq i < n} \left| \left\{ e \in E : \pi^{-1}(e) \text{ crosses the cut } (i, i+1) \right\} \right|.
\end{equation}

The Maximum Cutwidth problem is known to be NP-hard, making it a challenging problem to solve using classical algorithms \cite{karp1972reducibility}.

\section{Problem Definition}

In the Maximum Cutwidth problem, we are given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with non-negative edge weights $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. The goal is to find a cut $(A, B)$ that partitions the vertices into two disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ such that the total weight of the edges crossing the cut is maximized, but not exceeding half of the sum of the weights of all the edges. Formally, the objective is to maximize $w(A, B)$ subject to the constraint $w(A, B) \leq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{e \in E} w(e)$.

\section{Algorithm Description}

Our algorithm uses ARM assembly language to decide if the given values in registers R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Maximum Cutwidth problem. We assume that R0 contains the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut, denoted by $w(A, B)$, and R1 contains the sum of the weights of all the edges, denoted by $\sum_{e \in E} w(e)$. The algorithm follows the steps below:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Load the value 2 into register R2.
    \item Calculate half of the value stored in R1 by right-shifting R1 by one bit and store the result in register R3. This step computes the value $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{e \in E} w(e)$.
    \item Subtract the value stored in R0 from the value stored in R3 and store the result in register R4. This step computes the difference between $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{e \in E} w(e)$ and $w(A, B)$.
    \item Compare the value in R4 with 0. If R4 is greater than or equal to 0, then the ZERO flag in the processor status register (PSR) is set, indicating that the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Maximum Cutwidth problem. Otherwise, the ZERO flag is cleared.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Efficiency and Limitations}

The algorithm is efficient as it does not use any loops or branches, and only requires basic arithmetic and logical operations provided by the ARM instruction set. Moreover, each register is used only once, and a register is not used twice in an instruction, as required. The ZERO flag in the PSR is only set once in the algorithm, which is during the comparison of R4 with 0. This flag serves as an indicator of whether the given values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution to the problem or not.

However, there are some limitations to the algorithm. The largest number allowed in our example is 3, which means that the algorithm may not be suitable for graphs with larger edge weights or a larger number of edges. Additionally, the algorithm assumes that the values stored in R0 and R1 cannot be changed, which may not be the case in actual applications where the graph or the cut may be modified during the execution of the algorithm. Finally, the algorithm relies on the specific instructions provided by the ARM instruction set, which may not be available or efficient on other processor architectures.

\section{Extensions and Future Work}

There are several possible extensions and improvements to the algorithm. First, the algorithm can be generalized to handle larger graphs and edge weights by using additional registers or memory locations to store intermediate values. Second, the algorithm can be adapted to work with other processor architectures and instruction sets by replacing the ARM-specific instructions with equivalent instructions available in the target architecture. Third, the algorithm can be combined with other algorithms or heuristics for solving the Maximum Cutwidth problem more efficiently, such as by incorporating approximation algorithms or local search methods.

In conclusion, the proposed ARM assembly algorithm provides an efficient way to determine if the given values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Maximum Cutwidth problem without using loops or branches. The algorithm can be further improved and extended to handle larger graphs and edge weights, as well as to work with other processor architectures.
