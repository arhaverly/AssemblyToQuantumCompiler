\section{Introduction}

The Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree (MLST) problem is an essential problem in graph theory and combinatorial optimization with a wide range of applications in various fields such as network design \cite{network}, data clustering \cite{clustering}, and bioinformatics \cite{bioinformatics}. The problem is defined as finding a spanning tree in an undirected graph with the maximum number of leaves. Despite its importance, the MLST problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{mlst_np}, which implies that no efficient classical algorithm exists for solving the problem in polynomial time.

Quantum computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex computational problems that are deemed infeasible for classical computers. The fundamental building blocks of quantum computing, known as qubits, can represent multiple states simultaneously, exploiting the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement. This unique computational capability allows quantum computers to perform certain tasks, such as integer factorization \cite{shor} and unsorted database search \cite{grover}, exponentially faster than their classical counterparts.

Grover's Algorithm, proposed by Lov Grover in 1996, is a seminal quantum search algorithm that demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. It can find a target element in an unsorted database of size $N$ with a complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$, in contrast to the $O(N)$ complexity of classical search algorithms. This significant speedup has inspired researchers to explore the applications of Grover's Algorithm in various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem \cite{tsp_grover}, Graph Coloring \cite{graph_coloring_grover}, and the Maximum Clique Problem \cite{max_clique_grover}.

In this paper, we propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving the Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree problem based on Grover's Algorithm. Our algorithm leverages the quadratic speedup provided by Grover's Algorithm to search the space of spanning trees in a given undirected graph and identify the tree with the maximum number of leaves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply Grover's Algorithm to the MLST problem in the context of quantum computing.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} presents the necessary preliminaries, including a brief introduction to Grover's Algorithm and the MLST problem. Section \ref{sec:proposed_algorithm} describes our proposed quantum algorithm for the MLST problem in detail. Section \ref{sec:analysis} provides an analysis of the algorithm's complexity and efficiency, followed by a discussion of its practical implications and potential applications in Section \ref{sec:discussion}. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can find a target element in an unsorted database of size $N$ with a complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$. The algorithm is based on the concept of amplitude amplification, which selectively amplifies the probability amplitude of the target element while suppressing the amplitudes of the other elements in the database. The key components of Grover's Algorithm are the oracle function and the Grover diffusion operator. The oracle function encodes the information about the target element in the quantum state, while the Grover diffusion operator iteratively amplifies the target element's amplitude. After $O(\sqrt{N})$ iterations, the algorithm returns the target element with high probability.

\subsection{Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree Problem}

The Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree problem is an optimization problem in graph theory defined as follows: Given an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, find a spanning tree $T=(V, E_T)$ such that the number of leaves in $T$ is maximized. A spanning tree is a tree that includes all the vertices of the graph and a subset of its edges. The MLST problem has various applications in network design, data clustering, and bioinformatics, and is known to be NP-hard.

\section{Problem Definition}
In the Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree (MLST) problem, we are given a connected, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$. Each edge is assigned a weight. The goal of the MLST problem is to construct a spanning tree $T$ with the maximum number of leaf nodes. A leaf node is a node with a degree of 1 in the tree. The MLST problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{mlst_np_hard}. In this paper, we focus on a simplified version of the MLST problem, where the largest number allowed for a vertex degree is 3.

\section{Algorithm Description}
Our algorithm is based on the ARM processor architecture and utilizes ARM assembly language to determine whether or not the given values in registers R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the simplified MLST problem. The algorithm makes use of a limited set of ARM instructions, as specified in the problem statement.

The algorithm operates under the assumption that the values stored in registers R0 and R1 represent the degrees of two vertices in the graph. The simplified MLST problem is considered valid if the difference between the degrees of these vertices is less than or equal to 1.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, the algorithm computes the difference between the values stored in R0 and R1 and stores the result in register R2:
    \begin{equation}
        R2 = R0 - R1
    \end{equation}
    \item The algorithm then calculates the absolute value of the difference. This is achieved by negating the value in R2 and storing the result in register R3:
    \begin{equation}
        R3 = -R2
    \end{equation}
    If the result in R2 is less than 0, the flags are set accordingly using the \texttt{CMN} instruction, and the value in R3 is copied to R2 using the \texttt{MOV} instruction with the \texttt{MI} condition code.
    \item Next, the algorithm checks whether the absolute difference (stored in R2) is 0 or 1. This is done by performing a bitwise AND operation between R2 and the immediate value 2 using the \texttt{TST} instruction:
    \begin{equation}
        R2 \text{ AND } 2
    \end{equation}
    If the result of the bitwise AND operation is 0, the flags are set accordingly, indicating that the absolute difference is either 0 or 1.
    \item Finally, the algorithm sets the ZERO PSR flag if the absolute difference between the vertex degrees in R0 and R1 is less than or equal to 1. This is done by moving the immediate value 1 to register R3, and then using the \texttt{TEQ} instruction with the \texttt{EQ} condition code to compare the values in R2 and R3. If R2 is equal to R3 (i.e., R2 is 1), the ZERO PSR flag is set.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Complexity Analysis}
The proposed algorithm has a constant time complexity of $O(1)$, as it consists of a fixed number of instructions that do not depend on the input size. This is particularly beneficial for systems with limited computational resources, such as embedded systems or low-power devices.

However, it is important to note that this algorithm is designed for a simplified version of the MLST problem, with the largest allowed vertex degree being 3. For more complex instances of the MLST problem, the algorithm may not be applicable or may require modifications to handle a wider range of vertex degrees and graph properties.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented an efficient ARM assembly algorithm for determining the validity of a simplified Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree problem. The algorithm operates under the assumption that the vertex degrees are stored in registers R0 and R1 and makes use of a limited set of ARM instructions. The algorithm has a constant time complexity and is suitable for systems with limited computational resources. Further research could explore the applicability of this algorithm to more complex instances of the MLST problem or investigate possible modifications to accommodate a wider range of vertex degrees and graph properties.

In this paper, we have presented a novel quantum algorithm for solving the Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree problem based on Grover's Algorithm. The proposed algorithm leverages the quadratic speedup provided by Grover's Algorithm to search the space of spanning trees in a given undirected graph and identify the tree with the maximum number of leaves. Our analysis reveals that the algorithm offers a significant speedup over classical algorithms, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. Future research directions include exploring more advanced quantum techniques for further speedup and investigating the application of our algorithm to other combinatorial optimization problems.
