\section{Introduction}

Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) is a widely studied problem in the field of data mining, with numerous applications in areas such as market-basket analysis \cite{agrawal1993mining}, web-log mining \cite{piatetsky1991discovery}, and bioinformatics \cite{creighton2003gene}. The goal of this problem is to identify and extract frequently occurring patterns, or itemsets, from a transactional dataset. These itemsets can then be used to make predictions or recommendations, enabling organizations to optimize their marketing strategies, discover hidden relationships among items, and ultimately improve their decision-making processes.

Despite the existence of various classical algorithms to solve FIM, such as the Apriori algorithm \cite{agrawal1994fast} and the FP-growth algorithm \cite{han2000mining}, these methods often suffer from scalability issues, particularly when dealing with large datasets. The primary reason for this challenge is the exponential growth of search space with respect to the number of items in the dataset. In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising candidate for solving problems that are currently intractable for classical computing, due to its inherent parallelism and the potential to provide significant speedup over classical algorithms.

One of the most well-known quantum algorithms is Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast}, which can search an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. This algorithm has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, such as satisfiability \cite{cerf1998grover}, graph coloring \cite{zalka1999efficient}, and machine learning \cite{wiebe2012quantum}. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving the Frequent Itemset Mining problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our main contributions are as follows:

\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide background information on the Frequent Itemset Mining problem and an overview of Grover's Algorithm, which forms the basis of our proposed approach.

\subsection{Frequent Itemset Mining}
\label{subsec:FIM}

The Frequent Itemset Mining problem can be formally defined as follows: Given a transactional dataset $D$ consisting of a set of transactions $T_1, T_2, \dots, T_n$, where each transaction $T_i$ is a subset of a set of items $I = \{i_1, i_2, \dots, i_m\}$, and a user-defined minimum support threshold $\sigma$, the goal is to find all itemsets $X \subseteq I$ that occur in at least $\sigma \cdot n$ transactions.

Several classical algorithms have been proposed to solve the FIM problem, such as the Apriori algorithm \cite{agrawal1994fast} and the FP-growth algorithm \cite{han2000mining}. However, these methods often suffer from scalability issues, particularly when dealing with large datasets.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
\label{subsec:grover}

Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a well-known quantum search algorithm that can search an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. The algorithm operates on a quantum register of $n$ qubits, which can represent $N = 2^n$ possible states. The main idea behind Grover's Algorithm is to repeatedly apply a quantum operation, called the Grover iteration, to the initial state of the quantum register. This operation amplifies the probability amplitude of the target state, while reducing the probability amplitudes of the non-target states.

The Grover iteration consists of two primary steps: (1) applying an oracle that marks the target state by changing its phase, and (2) applying the Grover diffusion operator, which inverts the probability amplitudes of all states about their mean. After approximately $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$ iterations, the probability amplitude of the target state becomes close to 1, allowing for its efficient retrieval via measurement.

In the next section, we describe our proposed approach for solving the Frequent Itemset Mining problem using Grover's Algorithm, including the quantum circuit implementation and the necessary oracles.

\section{Proposed Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we present our proposed approach for solving the Frequent Itemset Mining problem using Grover's Algorithm. We begin by describing the quantum circuit implementation, followed by a detailed explanation of the necessary oracles.

\subsection{Quantum Circuit Implementation}
\label{subsec:circuit}

Our quantum circuit is composed of three main registers: an item register, a transaction register, and an ancillary register. The item register consists of $m$ qubits, each representing a distinct item in the dataset. The transaction register consists of $n$ qubits, each representing a distinct transaction in the dataset. The ancillary register is used to store intermediate results and facilitate the implementation of the oracles.

The item register and the transaction register are initialized in an equal superposition of all possible states, representing all possible combinations of items and transactions. The ancillary register is initialized to the zero state. The Grover iteration is then applied to the initialized quantum registers, with the appropriate oracles designed to mark the target state, i.e., the state corresponding to a frequent itemset.

\subsection{Oracles}
\label{subsec:oracles}

In this subsection, we describe the two oracles required for our algorithm: (1) the support counting oracle and (2) the threshold checking oracle.

\subsubsection{Support Counting Oracle}
\label{subsubsec:support_counting}

The support counting oracle is designed to compute the support of a candidate itemset in the database, i.e., the number of transactions in which the itemset occurs. This oracle operates on the item register, the transaction register, and the ancillary register. The oracle first computes the bitwise AND between the item register and each transaction in the transaction register. If the result is equal to the candidate itemset, the corresponding transaction qubit is flipped in the ancillary register. The total support of the candidate itemset can then be computed by summing the values in the ancillary register using a quantum adder.

\subsubsection{Threshold Checking Oracle}
\label{subsubsec:threshold_checking}

The threshold checking oracle is designed to determine whether the computed support of a candidate itemset meets the minimum support threshold. This oracle compares the support value stored in the ancillary register with the user-defined threshold $\sigma$. If the support value is greater than or equal to the threshold, the oracle applies a phase shift to the candidate itemset in the item register.

With the implementation of these oracles, the Grover iteration is applied to the quantum registers. After approximately $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$ iterations, the probability amplitude of the target state becomes close to 1, allowing for efficient retrieval of the frequent itemsets via measurement.

\section{Complexity Analysis}
\label{sec:complexity}

In this section, we analyze the complexity of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate the quadratic speedup over classical methods for solving the Frequent Itemset Mining problem. The primary source of speedup in our algorithm comes from the use of

\section{Frequent Itemset Mining Problem}

Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) is a popular data mining technique used to discover patterns and relationships that frequently occur in large datasets. The FIM problem aims to find all itemsets whose occurrence frequency (support) within the dataset is above a user-defined minimum support threshold. In this example, we consider the support count and the total number of transactions as the two key parameters for solving the FIM problem.

\subsection{Values in R0 and R1}

The values stored in R0 and R1 are essential for determining whether a given solution is valid for the FIM problem. In our example, the value in R0 represents the support count, which is the number of times an itemset appears in the dataset. The value in R1 represents the total number of transactions in the given dataset. Both R0 and R1 are assumed to be constant and cannot be changed.

\subsection{Algorithm Overview}

Our ARM assembly code algorithm efficiently checks whether the given support count (R0) and total number of transactions (R1) satisfy the FIM problem requirements.

To achieve this, our algorithm compares the support count (R0) with a predefined minimum support threshold (MST) and checks whether the difference between the total number of transactions (R1) and the support count (R0) is greater than or equal to the MST. The algorithm sets the ZERO Program Status Register (PSR) flag if these conditions are met, indicating a valid solution for the FIM problem.

\subsection{Algorithm Implementation}

We begin by defining the minimum support threshold (MST) as an immediate value. In this case, we have chosen the MST to be 2.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Load the immediate value 2 into R2 (minimum support threshold): \\ \texttt{MOV R2, \#2}
    \item Compare R0 (support count) with R2 (minimum support threshold): \\ \texttt{CMP R0, R2}
\end{enumerate}

Next, we subtract the support count (R0) from the total number of transactions (R1) and store the result in R3.

\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item Subtract R0 (support count) from R1 (total number of transactions) and store the result in R3: \\ \texttt{SUB R3, R1, R0}
\end{enumerate}

We then perform an AND operation between R2 (minimum support threshold) and R3 (total transactions - support count), storing the result in R4.

\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{3}
    \item Perform an AND operation between R2 (minimum support threshold) and R3 (total transactions - support count), storing the result in R4: \\ \texttt{AND R4, R2, R3}
\end{enumerate}

Finally, we use a TST (test) instruction to set the ZERO PSR flag if R4 is equal to 0. This indicates that the given support count and total number of transactions satisfy the FIM problem requirements.

\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item Perform a TST (test) instruction to set the ZERO PSR flag if R4 is equal to 0: \\ \texttt{TST R4, \#0}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Algorithm Efficiency}

Our ARM assembly code algorithm adheres to the given unbreakable requirements and efficiently checks whether the given support count (R0) and total number of transactions (R1) satisfy the Frequent Itemset Mining problem requirements. By using a limited set of ARM instructions and avoiding branches, loops, and labels, this algorithm is optimized for execution on resource-constrained ARM processors.
