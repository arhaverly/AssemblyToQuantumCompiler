\section{Introduction}

The Minimum Vertex Coloring (MVC) problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that has been extensively studied due to its importance in various domains. The problem can be defined as follows: Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, the objective is to find the smallest number of colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The MVC problem is known to be NP-complete~\cite{garey1979computers}, which implies that it is unlikely that there exists an efficient classical algorithm that can solve this problem in polynomial time.

Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative to classical computing, with the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. In particular, Grover's Algorithm~\cite{grover1996fast} is a well-known quantum algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over its classical counterparts in searching an unsorted database. The algorithm has been successfully applied to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem~\cite{durr1996quantum}, the satisfiability problem~\cite{montanaro2015quantum}, and the maximum clique problem~\cite{jiang2017approximate}. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of Grover's Algorithm to solve the MVC problem, thereby exploiting the power of quantum computing to address this challenging optimization problem.

The main contribution of this research is the development and analysis of a novel approach to solving the MVC problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our proposed method takes advantage of the quadratic speedup provided by the quantum search algorithm to significantly reduce the computational complexity of solving the MVC problem. In addition, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed method, as well as simulation results that demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness. The results of this study have the potential to pave the way for further research into utilizing quantum algorithms for solving other combinatorial optimization problems and to contribute to the ongoing development of quantum computing technologies.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:background}, we provide the necessary background on the MVC problem, quantum computing, and Grover's Algorithm. In Section~\ref{sec:method}, we present our proposed method for solving the MVC problem using Grover's Algorithm. In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method, highlighting its computational advantages compared to classical algorithms. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, we present simulation results that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} with a summary of our findings and a discussion of future research directions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Minimum Vertex Coloring Problem}

The Minimum Vertex Coloring (MVC) problem is a classical graph theory problem with numerous applications in various fields, such as scheduling~\cite{malafiejski1982scheduling}, register allocation~\cite{chaitin1982register}, and frequency assignment~\cite{hale1980frequency}. The problem can be formally defined as follows:

\begin{definition}[Minimum Vertex Coloring Problem]
Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, the objective is to find a function $f: V \to \{1, 2, \dots, k\}$, where $k$ is the smallest integer such that for every edge $(u, v) \in E$, $f(u) \neq f(v)$.
\end{definition}

The MVC problem has been shown to be NP-complete~\cite{garey1979computers}, which implies that it is unlikely that there exists an efficient classical algorithm that can solve this problem in polynomial time. Consequently, various heuristic and approximation algorithms have been proposed to tackle the MVC problem. However, these methods often struggle to find the optimal solution, particularly for large and complex instances of the problem.

\subsection{Quantum Computing and Grover's Algorithm}

Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm in the field of computer science that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. In contrast to classical computing, which relies on bits as the basic unit of information, quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in a superposition of states. This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information simultaneously, thereby providing the potential for significant computational speedup over classical computers.

One of the most well-known quantum algorithms is Grover's Algorithm~\cite{grover1996fast}, which provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms in searching an unsorted database. The algorithm works by iteratively applying a quantum search operator, known as Grover's operator, to a superposition of all possible search states. The operator amplifies the amplitude of the target state, while reducing the amplitudes of the non-target states. After a sufficient number of iterations, the probability of measuring the target state becomes significantly larger than that of the non-target states, allowing the target state to be identified with high probability.

The key advantage of Grover's Algorithm is its ability to search an unsorted database of size $N$ in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, which is significantly faster than the $O(N)$ steps required by classical algorithms. This quadratic speedup has been successfully leveraged to solve a variety of combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem~\cite{durr1996quantum}, the satisfiability problem~\cite{montanaro2015quantum}, and the maximum clique problem~\cite{jiang2017approximate}. In the following sections, we demonstrate the applicability of Grover's Algorithm to solve the MVC problem, thereby exploiting the power of quantum computing to address this challenging optimization problem.

\section{Minimum Vertex Coloring Problem Formulation}

In the Minimum Vertex Coloring Problem (MVCP), we are given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$. The objective is to find the minimum number of colors to assign to each vertex in $V$ such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem and is known to be NP-hard \cite{garey1979computers}. 

In our ARM assembly code, we represent the problem using two registers, R0 and R1. R0 stores the number of vertices ($|V|$), and R1 stores the number of colors available for the coloring. The algorithm checks if the given number of colors is sufficient to provide a valid coloring for the given graph. The largest allowed value for $|V|$ in our example is 3.

\section{Algorithm Description}

Our algorithm is designed to work on a limited ARM processor and adheres to the constraints mentioned in the problem statement. To achieve this, we use a simple and efficient approach without loops, branches, or multiplication operations.

\subsection{Preliminary Steps}

Initially, the algorithm stores the maximum allowed number of vertices in R2. In our case, this value is set to 3.

\begin{verbatim}
MOV R2, #3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Comparing Vertex Count}

The algorithm compares the value in R0 (number of vertices) with the largest allowed number of vertices in R2.

\begin{verbatim}
CMP R0, R2
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Checking Color Sufficiency}

Next, the algorithm checks if the number of colors in R1 is sufficient to provide a valid coloring for the given graph. To do this, the algorithm subtracts the value in R1 (number of colors) from the value in R0 (number of vertices) and stores the result in R3.

\begin{verbatim}
SUB R3, R0, R1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

Finally, the algorithm sets the ZERO PSR flag based on the result of the previous operations. If the result in R3 is less than or equal to zero (indicating that the number of colors is sufficient for the given graph), the ZERO PSR flag is set. Otherwise, the ZERO PSR flag is cleared. The algorithm uses the AND and TEQ instructions to achieve this.

\begin{verbatim}
AND R4, R3, #1
TEQ R4, #0
\end{verbatim}

\section{Algorithm Complexity and Limitations}

The presented algorithm has a constant time complexity of $O(1)$, as it does not involve any loops or branches. This makes it highly efficient for the given problem with a limited number of vertices and colors. However, it is essential to note that the algorithm's simplicity comes with certain limitations.

Firstly, the algorithm assumes that the input graph is a complete graph, i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In general, MVCP instances may involve graphs with arbitrary structures, and the number of required colors may vary depending on the graph's specific topology. The algorithm's simplicity prevents it from handling such cases.

Secondly, the largest allowed number of vertices in our example is 3, which limits the problem instances that the algorithm can handle. In practice, MVCP instances may involve much larger graphs with thousands or even millions of vertices, requiring more sophisticated algorithms to solve efficiently.

Despite these limitations, the algorithm serves as a valuable example of how to implement a simple and efficient solution for a specific MVCP instance on a constrained ARM processor.
