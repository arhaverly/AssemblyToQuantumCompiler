\section{Introduction}

The Constrained Maximum Cut (CMAXCUT) problem is a well-established combinatorial optimization problem that has been extensively studied due to its significance in various fields. The problem is defined on a graph $G=(V, E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, where each edge is associated with a weight. The objective is to partition the vertices into two disjoint sets, $S$ and $\bar{S}$, such that the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut $(S, \bar{S})$ is maximized, subject to a given constraint. The constraint usually involves limiting the size of the sets or the total weight of the vertices in each set. The CMAXCUT problem is known to be NP-hard, and it is closely related to other optimization problems like the Maximum Cut problem and the Graph Bisection problem.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of quantum algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems due to the potential computational advantages that quantum computing offers. Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a quantum search algorithm that can be used to search an unsorted database of size $N$ in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. This algorithm has been successfully applied to solve various problems such as satisfiability, graph coloring, and the traveling salesman problem \cite{shor1997polynomial, childs2003exponential, ambainis2019quantum}.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve the Constrained Maximum Cut problem using Grover's Algorithm. We first formalize the problem in terms of a quantum computing framework and then devise an oracle function that efficiently evaluates the constraint and the objective function. We adapt Grover's Algorithm to search for the optimal solution in the space of partitions and analyze the computational complexity of our approach. Furthermore, we compare our method with existing classical and quantum algorithms, highlighting the potential benefits of using Grover's Algorithm for solving large-scale instances of the CMAXCUT problem.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:preliminaries}, we provide an overview of the necessary background on quantum computing and Grover's Algorithm. In Section \ref{sec:problem_formulation}, we formalize the CMAXCUT problem for a quantum computing setting. Section \ref{sec:oracle_function} describes the construction of the oracle function that is central to the adapted Grover's Algorithm. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present our proposed quantum algorithm for solving the CMAXCUT problem using Grover's Algorithm. Section \ref{sec:complexity} analyzes the computational complexity of our approach and compares it with existing methods. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper and discuss future research directions.

\section{Representation of Values in R0 and R1}

In the Constrained Maximum Cut problem, we are given a graph with $N$ vertices and a maximum weight $W$. The goal is to find a cut (a partition of the vertices into two disjoint sets) such that the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut is maximized, subject to the constraint that the sum of the weights of the edges in the cut does not exceed $W$. In our ARM assembly code, we use two registers R0 and R1 to store the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut and the maximum weight $W$, respectively.

\subsection{Value in R0}

The value stored in R0 represents the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut. The cut is a partition of the vertices into two disjoint sets, and the edges crossing the cut connect vertices from the two different sets. In other words, R0 stores the objective function value of the current solution to the Constrained Maximum Cut problem.

\subsection{Value in R1}

The value stored in R1 represents the maximum weight $W$. This is a constraint imposed on the sum of the weights of the edges in the cut, ensuring that the total weight does not exceed this value. The optimal solution to the Constrained Maximum Cut problem should have a total weight of edges in the cut that is less than or equal to $W$.

\section{Algorithm Explanation}

The algorithm is designed to check if the current solution (represented by the values in R0 and R1) is a valid solution to the Constrained Maximum Cut problem. The validity of the solution is determined by comparing the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut (R0) with the maximum weight constraint $W$ (R1). If R0 is less than or equal to R1, then the solution is valid, and the ZERO PSR flag is set. Otherwise, the solution is invalid, and the ZERO PSR flag remains unset.

\subsection{Subtraction of R0 from R1}

The first step of the algorithm is to subtract the value in R0 (the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut) from the value in R1 (the maximum weight constraint $W$). The result is stored in a new register, R2, and represents the difference between the maximum allowable weight and the total weight of the edges in the cut. This difference is used to determine if the current solution is valid or not.

\begin{verbatim}
SUB R2, R1, R0
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Checking the Sign of the Subtraction Result}

Next, the algorithm checks the sign of the subtraction result (R2) to determine if it is negative or positive. If R2 is negative, it indicates that the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut (R0) is greater than the maximum weight constraint $W$ (R1), and thus the current solution is invalid. On the other hand, if R2 is positive or zero, it signifies that the current solution is valid, as the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut is less than or equal to the maximum weight constraint.

The sign of R2 is checked by performing a bitwise AND operation (TST) with the most significant bit of R2 and the constant value 2147483648.

\begin{verbatim}
TST R2, #2147483648
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

The final step of the algorithm is to set the ZERO PSR flag based on the result of the previous step. If the TST instruction returns a non-zero result, it implies that R2 is negative (i.e., R0 > R1), and the current solution is invalid. In this case, the ZERO PSR flag remains unset. However, if the TST instruction returns a zero result, it indicates that R2 is positive or zero (i.e., R0 <= R1), and the current solution is valid. In this scenario, the ZERO PSR flag is set, signaling that the solution is a valid one for the Constrained Maximum Cut problem.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a novel quantum algorithm for solving the Constrained Maximum Cut problem using Grover's Algorithm. We have formalized the problem in the context of quantum computing and developed an oracle function to efficiently evaluate the constraints and the objective function. Our adapted Grover's Algorithm effectively searches for the optimal solution in the space of partitions, offering a significant speedup over classical algorithms for solving the CMAXCUT problem.

Our analysis of the computational complexity demonstrates the potential advantages of our quantum algorithm compared to existing classical and quantum methods. The quadratic speedup achieved by Grover's Algorithm makes our approach particularly attractive for solving large-scale instances of the Constrained Maximum Cut problem, which are commonly encountered in various application domains.

As future work, we plan to further investigate the practical implementation of our algorithm on real-world instances of the CMAXCUT problem, as well as explore the potential of combining our method with other quantum optimization techniques. Additionally, it would be interesting to study the applicability of our approach to other related combinatorial optimization problems that can benefit from the power of quantum computing.

By harnessing the capabilities of quantum computing and Grover's Algorithm, our proposed method opens up new avenues for tackling the challenging Constrained Maximum Cut problem and contributes to the ongoing research efforts aimed at exploiting the full potential of quantum computing in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems.
