\section{Introduction}

The Maximum Dispersion Problem (MDP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that seeks to identify a subset of elements from a given set, such that the minimum distance between any two elements in the subset is maximized. This problem has attracted significant attention due to its relevance in diverse application areas, including communication network design, facility location, and wireless sensor placement \cite{erdemir2013efficient}. Despite its importance, the MDP is known to be NP-hard \cite{karp1972reducibility}, and thus, finding efficient algorithms to solve it remains an open challenge.

Classical algorithms for solving the MDP include exact methods such as integer programming and branch-and-bound, as well as heuristic methods such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search \cite{erdemir2013efficient}. Although these methods have been successful in solving small to moderately-sized instances of the MDP, they often suffer from high time complexity and limited scalability. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new techniques that can provide faster and more efficient solutions to the MDP, particularly in the context of large-scale problems.

Quantum computing, a rapidly evolving field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations, offers promising opportunities for addressing complex optimization problems. One of the most well-known quantum algorithms is Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast}, which has been shown to outperform classical search algorithms in terms of time complexity. Specifically, Grover's Algorithm can search for a target element in an unsorted database of size $N$ with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$, compared to the $O(N)$ complexity of classical search algorithms.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the Maximum Dispersion Problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We propose a method to efficiently encode the MDP into a quantum oracle, which can be utilized by Grover's Algorithm to search for the optimal solution.
    
    \item We analyze the time complexity of the proposed method and compare it with existing classical algorithms, demonstrating the potential advantages of using quantum computing to solve the MDP.
    
    \item We discuss the practical implications of our results for various application areas and outline directions for future research in the context of quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we provide background information on the Maximum Dispersion Problem and Grover's Algorithm. In Section \ref{sec:proposed_method}, we present our proposed method for solving the MDP using Grover's Algorithm, including a detailed description of the quantum oracle encoding and the overall algorithm. In Section \ref{sec:complexity_analysis}, we analyze the time complexity of our proposed method and compare it with classical algorithms. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper and discuss future research directions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Maximum Dispersion Problem}

The Maximum Dispersion Problem (MDP) can be formally defined as follows. Given a set of elements $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ and a distance function $d: V \times V \to \mathbb{R}^+$, the objective is to find a subset $S \subseteq V$ of cardinality $k$, such that the minimum distance between any two elements in $S$ is maximized. Mathematically, the MDP can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\max_{S \subseteq V, |S| = k} \min_{u, v \in S, u \neq v} d(u, v).
\end{equation}

As mentioned earlier, the MDP is an NP-hard problem, which implies that it is unlikely to have an efficient algorithm for solving it in the worst case. Nevertheless, various methods have been proposed to tackle the MDP, including exact algorithms and heuristics. However, the performance of these methods is often limited by their high time complexity, motivating the exploration of alternative approaches based on quantum computing.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a quantum search algorithm that can efficiently locate a target element in an unsorted database. The key idea behind Grover's Algorithm is to iteratively apply a quantum oracle, which encodes the information about the target element, and use the principles of quantum superposition and interference to amplify the probability of finding the target element.

The main steps of Grover's Algorithm can be outlined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prepare the initial quantum state, which is an equal superposition of all possible database elements.
    
    \item Apply the quantum oracle to flip the sign of the target element in the quantum state.
    
    \item Apply the Grover diffusion operator to amplify the amplitude of the target element.
    
    \item Repeat steps 2 and 3 for an appropriate number of iterations, which is approximately $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the size of the database.
    
    \item Perform a measurement on the quantum state to obtain the target element with high probability.
\end{enumerate}

Grover's Algorithm has been proven to be optimal, as no other quantum algorithm can search an unsorted database with better time complexity \cite{bennett1997strengths}. Therefore, it serves as a natural starting point for developing quantum algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as the Maximum Dispersion Problem.


\section{Representation of R0 and R1}

In the context of the Maximum Dispersion problem, the values stored in R0 and R1 represent two distinct points in a one-dimensional space. The goal of this problem is to determine if the dispersion, or distance, between these two points is equal to or greater than a given threshold T. In this specific example, the threshold is set to 3. The Maximum Dispersion problem has various applications in fields like data science, operations research, and clustering algorithms.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

The algorithm presented in this paper aims to evaluate the validity of the given points in R0 and R1 with respect to the Maximum Dispersion problem without using loops or branching instructions. This is achieved by using a sequence of ARM assembly instructions, adhering to a strict set of constraints. The algorithm performs the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate the absolute difference between the values in R0 and R1.
    \item Compare the obtained absolute difference with the threshold T.
    \item Set the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag based on the comparison result.
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithm Details}

\subsection{Calculating the Absolute Difference}

The first step in the algorithm is to compute the absolute difference between the values stored in R0 and R1, which represents the distance between the two points in the one-dimensional space. To achieve this, we first create a copy of R0 in another register, R3. Then, we compare R0 and R1 using the CMP instruction. Based on this comparison, we will update the value of R3 using the RSB (Reverse Subtract) instruction. If R0 is greater than or equal to R1, R3 will be updated to the difference between R1 and R0. Otherwise, R3 remains unchanged.

Next, we compute the absolute difference between R0 and R1 by subtracting the updated value of R3 from R1 and storing the result in R2. At this point, R2 contains the absolute difference between R0 and R1.

\subsection{Comparing the Absolute Difference with the Threshold}

After obtaining the absolute difference between the points, we need to compare this value with the threshold T (3 in this example). To do this, we first store the value of the threshold in another register, R4. Then, we use the TEQ (Test Equivalence) instruction to compare R2 and R4. This instruction sets the ZERO flag in the PSR if the two compared values are equal.

\section{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

The ZERO PSR flag is used to store the result of the comparison between the absolute difference and the threshold T. If the distance between the two points is equal to the threshold, the ZERO flag will be set, indicating a valid solution to the Maximum Dispersion problem. The ZERO flag can then be used by other parts of the program to make decisions based on the result of this comparison.

\section{Discussion}

The presented algorithm offers a solution to the Maximum Dispersion problem for a specific case with two points and a threshold of 3 while adhering to a strict set of constraints. The algorithm avoids using loops, branches, and a limited set of instructions, making it suitable for environments with limited resources or strict performance requirements.

While the algorithm is designed for a specific case, it can be adapted to more complex cases and different thresholds by modifying the instructions and registers accordingly. However, it is worth noting that the efficiency and simplicity of the algorithm might be affected as the problem's complexity increases.

\section{Conclusion}
