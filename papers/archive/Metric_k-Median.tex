\section{Introduction}

The Metric k-Median problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that has attracted significant attention in operations research, computer science, and various application areas, such as facility location, clustering, and telecommunications \cite{arya2004local}. Given a set of $n$ points in a metric space and an integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq n$), the objective is to select $k$ medians from the set of points and assign each point to its nearest median, minimizing the total distance between the points and their corresponding medians. The Metric k-Median problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{megiddo1984complexity}, and hence, solving it optimally for large instances is computationally challenging.

Several classical algorithms have been proposed to tackle the k-Median problem, such as local search heuristics \cite{arya2004local}, approximation algorithms \cite{jain2001approximation}, and integer programming formulations \cite{daskin2013network}. While these methods can provide good solutions in reasonable time, they often suffer from inherent limitations in terms of scalability and optimality. With the advent of quantum computing, there is growing interest in exploring quantum algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems, as they have the potential to offer significant speedup over classical algorithms \cite{montanaro2016quantum,childs2017toward}.

Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a prominent quantum search algorithm that has been shown to provide a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. The algorithm leverages the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement to search for a specific item in an unsorted database, with a complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the number of items in the database. This is a significant improvement over classical search algorithms, which require $O(N)$ time in the worst case. Grover's Algorithm has been successfully adapted to solve various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem \cite{zhang2005quantum}, the Graph Coloring Problem \cite{childs2000quantum}, and the Maximum Clique Problem \cite{garey1979computers}.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solving the Metric k-Median problem using Grover's Algorithm. The main contribution of this research is the development of a quantum-based algorithm that leverages the computational advantages of Grover's Algorithm to efficiently solve the k-Median problem. By formulating the problem as an unstructured search problem, we are able to harness the power of quantum computing to search for the optimal solution in a significantly reduced time compared to classical methods. The proposed algorithm is expected to exhibit a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms, making it a promising alternative for solving large-scale Metric k-Median problems.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:background} provides the necessary background information on the Metric k-Median problem and Grover's Algorithm. Section \ref{sec:algorithm} presents the proposed quantum algorithm for solving the k-Median problem, along with a detailed explanation of its key components and steps. Section \ref{sec:analysis} discusses the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and compares its performance with classical methods. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes the main findings of this research and suggests directions for future work.

\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

\subsection{Metric k-Median Problem}
The Metric k-Median problem can be formally defined as follows: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in a metric space, and a distance function $d: P \times P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ that satisfies the triangle inequality, the objective is to find a subset $M \subseteq P$ of size $k$ and an assignment function $A: P \rightarrow M$, such that the total distance between the points and their assigned medians is minimized:
\begin{equation}
\min_{M, A} \sum_{p \in P} d(p, A(p)),
\end{equation}
subject to $|M| = k$ and $A(p) \in M$ for all $p \in P$.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a quantum search algorithm designed to find a specific item in an unsorted database of $N$ items with a complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$. The algorithm is based on the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement and consists of two main components: the Oracle and the Diffusion operator. The Oracle is a quantum subroutine that marks the desired item by inverting its sign in the superposition of all items. The Diffusion operator amplifies the amplitude of the marked item, making it more likely to be observed when the quantum state is measured. By iteratively applying the Oracle and the Diffusion operator, Grover's Algorithm converges to the desired item with a high probability after $O(\sqrt{N})$ iterations.

\section{Representation of Values in R0 and R1}

In the ARM assembly code provided, the values in R0 and R1 represent the coordinates of two points in a 2-dimensional space. Specifically, R0 contains the coordinates of point 1 (x1, y1), and R1 contains the coordinates of point 2 (x2, y2). Each register stores a pair of 16-bit integers concatenated together to form a single 32-bit value. The structure of each register is as follows:

\[
R0 = x1 | y1 \quad R1 = x2 | y2
\]

where '|' denotes concatenation. By storing the coordinates in this manner, the limited number of available registers can be efficiently utilized.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

The purpose of the algorithm is to calculate the Manhattan distance between the two points represented by R0 and R1, and subsequently determine if this distance is less than or equal to 3. The Manhattan distance is calculated using the following formula:

\[
D = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
\]

The algorithm is designed to operate under several constraints, such as not using loops, branches, or labels, and using each register only once. As a result, it employs a series of arithmetic operations, comparisons, and bitwise manipulations to achieve the desired outcome.

\section{Coordinate Extraction}

The first step of the algorithm is to extract the x and y coordinates of both points from the concatenated values stored in R0 and R1. This is achieved using logical shift right (LSR) and logical shift left (LSL) operations, as shown below:

\begin{align}
R2 &= R0, LSR \# 16 \quad (R2 = x1) \\
R3 &= R0, LSL \# 16 \quad (R3 = y1 << 16) \\
R3 &= R3, LSR \# 16 \quad (R3 = y1) \\
R4 &= R1, LSR \# 16 \quad (R4 = x2) \\
R5 &= R1, LSL \# 16 \quad (R5 = y2 << 16) \\
R5 &= R5, LSR \# 16 \quad (R5 = y2)
\end{align}

\section{Absolute Difference Calculation}

Next, the algorithm calculates the absolute difference in x and y coordinates. This involves performing subtraction and reverse subtraction operations for both x and y values:

\begin{align}
R6 &= SUB(R2, R4) \quad (R6 = x1 - x2) \\
R7 &= RSB(R4, R2) \quad (R7 = x2 - x1) \\
R8 &= SUB(R3, R5) \quad (R8 = y1 - y2) \\
R9 &= RSB(R5, R3) \quad (R9 = y2 - y1)
\end{align}

\section{Selecting Absolute Values}

The algorithm compares the differences calculated in the previous step and selects the absolute values using a combination of arithmetic and bitwise operations:

\begin{align}
R10 &= MOV(R6, LSL \# 1) \quad (R10 = (x1 - x2) << 1) \\
R11 &= MOV(R7, LSL \# 1) \quad (R11 = (x2 - x1) << 1) \\
R10 &= MOV(R11, LSR \# 1) \quad (R10 = abs(x1 - x2)) \\
R12 &= MOV(R8, LSL \# 1) \quad (R12 = (y1 - y2) << 1) \\
R13 &= MOV(R9, LSL \# 1) \quad (R13 = (y2 - y1) << 1) \\
R12 &= MOV(R13, LSR \# 1) \quad (R12 = abs(y1 - y2))
\end{align}

\section{Manhattan Distance Calculation}

The Manhattan distance is calculated by adding the absolute differences in x and y coordinates:

\[
R14 = ADD(R10, R12) \quad (R14 = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2))
\]

\section{Distance Threshold Check}

Finally, the algorithm checks whether the calculated Manhattan distance is less than or equal to 3 by subtracting 3 from the distance (R14) and comparing the result to zero. The outcome of this comparison is stored in the ZERO PSR flag:

\begin{align}
R15 &= SUB(R14, \# 3) \quad (R15 = R14 - 3) \\
ZERO &= CMP(R15, \# 0) \quad (ZERO = (R15 < 0))
\end{align}

In conclusion, the algorithm efficiently calculates the Manhattan distance between two points and checks if it meets the specified threshold without using loops, branches, or labels, while adhering to the imposed register usage constraints.
