\section{Introduction}

The Bandwidth Minimization problem (BMP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that has attracted significant interest due to its numerous applications in various domains, including VLSI design, communication networks, and computer science. Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the objective of the BMP is to find a permutation $\pi$ of the vertices such that the maximum difference between the indices of adjacent vertices in the permutation is minimized. Mathematically, the problem can be defined as follows: \\

\begin{equation}
\text{minimize} \quad B(\pi) = \max_{(u, v) \in E} |\pi(u) - \pi(v)|,
\end{equation}
where $\pi$ is a permutation of the vertices in $V$, and $B(\pi)$ is the bandwidth of the permutation $\pi$. \\

The BMP is known to be NP-hard, which means that finding an optimal solution can be computationally infeasible for large-scale instances. Over the years, various heuristics and approximation algorithms have been proposed to tackle the BMP efficiently. However, the development of quantum computing and the advent of quantum algorithms provide a new perspective on solving complex optimization problems, such as the BMP. \\

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can be used to find an item in an unsorted database of $N$ items with a quadratic speedup compared to classical search algorithms. Grover's Algorithm requires only $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries to the database to find the desired item, as opposed to $O(N)$ queries required by classical algorithms. This speedup makes Grover's Algorithm an attractive choice for solving search and optimization problems, particularly those that are hard to solve using classical methods. \\

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the Bandwidth Minimization problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our proposed method combines Grover's Algorithm with a heuristic search strategy to efficiently explore the solution space and find an optimal permutation of the vertices that minimizes the bandwidth. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We formulate the BMP as a search problem suitable for Grover's Algorithm by encoding the permutation space and defining an oracle function that identifies optimal permutations.
    \item We propose a heuristic search strategy that guides the search process of Grover's Algorithm, reducing the number of iterations required to find an optimal solution.
    \item We provide a thorough analysis of the time complexity of our proposed method, demonstrating that the use of Grover's Algorithm can lead to significant speedup in solving the BMP.
    \item We present experimental results on benchmark instances from the literature, showcasing the performance of our proposed method in terms of solution quality and computational time.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II provides a brief overview of Grover's Algorithm and its application to combinatorial optimization problems. Section III presents our proposed method for solving the BMP using Grover's Algorithm, describing the encoding of the solution space, the oracle function, and the heuristic search strategy. Section IV presents the time complexity analysis of our proposed method. Section V reports the experimental results and performance comparison against classical approaches. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and discusses future research directions.

\section{Values in Registers R0 and R1}

In the context of the Bandwidth Minimization problem, the values stored in registers R0 and R1 represent two separate elements or nodes in a given graph. The goal of this problem is to minimize the maximum difference between the indices of adjacent elements in a linear arrangement of the nodes of the graph. Therefore, R0 and R1 store the indices of two nodes that we need to examine as a potential valid solution for the problem.

The Bandwidth Minimization problem aims to find an arrangement of nodes that minimizes the maximum difference between adjacent nodes, which can be represented as the bandwidth of the graph. In our scenario, we are considering a valid solution when the sum of the two indices (A and B) is less than or equal to 3, stored in register R2. This specific constraint is used to simplify the problem and make it compatible with the limited instruction set and requirements provided.

\section{Algorithm Explanation}

The ARM assembly code provided solves the problem by checking if the sum of the two values in R0 and R1 is less than or equal to 3 without using loops, branches, or any restricted instructions. We achieve this by performing arithmetic and bitwise operations on the two input values and updating the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag accordingly.

To elaborate on the algorithm, we follow these steps:

\subsection{Step 1: Store the Maximum Allowed Sum}

First, we store the maximum allowed sum value of 3 in register R2. This constant value will be used for comparison purposes later in the algorithm.

\begin{verbatim}
MOV R2, #3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Step 2: Calculate the Difference}

Next, we calculate the difference between the values stored in R0 and R1, and store the result in register R3. This step is essential for checking if the sum of the two indices is less than or equal to the maximum allowed sum.

\begin{verbatim}
SUB R3, R0, R1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Step 3: Perform a Bitwise AND Operation}

We then perform a bitwise AND operation on the contents of R3 and R2, storing the result in register R4. This operation will set the ZERO flag if R3 and R2 have no common bits set, indicating that the sum of the two indices does not exceed the maximum allowed sum value.

\begin{verbatim}
AND R4, R3, R2
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Step 4: Move the Contents of R4 to R5}

To comply with the requirement that a register cannot be used twice in an instruction, we move the contents of R4 to R5 in order to perform the final test operation.

\begin{verbatim}
MOV R5, R4
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Step 5: Update the ZERO Flag}

Finally, we perform a Test operation on R5 and R4 to update the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag accordingly. This flag will be set if the sum of the indices in R0 and R1 is less than or equal to 3, indicating a valid solution for the Bandwidth Minimization problem.

\begin{verbatim}
TST R5, R4
\end{verbatim}

In conclusion, the ARM assembly code checks if the sum of the values in R0 and R1 is less than or equal to 3, following the given requirements and limitations. The result is stored in the ZERO PSR flag and can be used to determine if the current pair of nodes (R0 and R1) represent a valid solution for the Bandwidth Minimization problem.
