\section{Introduction}

The k-Partition problem is a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. Given a set of positive integers, the problem seeks to determine whether it is possible to partition the set into k subsets with equal sum. The k-Partition problem has various applications, including load balancing, scheduling, and resource allocation, and is closely related to other combinatorial problems such as bin packing and the subset sum problem.

The k-Partition problem is known to be NP-hard, meaning that no efficient algorithm is known to solve it in the worst case, and it is unlikely that such an algorithm exists \cite{garey1979computers}. Consequently, researchers have explored various approaches to solving the k-Partition problem, including exact algorithms, approximation algorithms, and heuristic methods. However, these methods typically experience an exponential increase in computational complexity as the problem size grows, making them infeasible for large problem instances.

Quantum computing, an emerging paradigm of computation, offers the potential to solve certain computational problems more efficiently than classical computers. One such quantum algorithm, Grover's Algorithm, has been shown to provide a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for unsorted database search \cite{grover1996fast}. This speedup has been extended to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as satisfiability and graph isomorphism \cite{childs2017quantum}. In this paper, we propose a methodology for applying Grover's Algorithm to the k-Partition problem and evaluate the performance of our approach.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We present a methodology for transforming the k-Partition problem into a suitable form for Grover's Algorithm. This transformation involves encoding the problem as a binary function whose output is 1 if and only if a given input represents a valid k-partition.

    \item We discuss the implementation of our methodology on quantum computers, including the construction of an oracle for the k-Partition problem and the adaptation of Grover's Algorithm to handle multiple solutions.

    \item We analyze the performance of our approach and demonstrate that it provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for solving the k-Partition problem. We also discuss the potential for additional speedup through algorithmic improvements and hardware advancements.

    \item We provide a detailed comparison of our approach with existing methods for solving the k-Partition problem, highlighting the advantages and limitations of our method in terms of efficiency and applicability.

\end{enumerate}

Section \ref{sec:methodology} describes our methodology for applying Grover's Algorithm to the k-Partition problem.

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide a brief overview of the k-Partition problem and Grover's Algorithm.

\subsection{The k-Partition Problem}

The k-Partition problem can be formally defined as follows:

\begin{definition}[k-Partition Problem]
Given a set of $n$ positive integers $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ and an integer $k \geq 2$, determine whether there exists a partition of $A$ into $k$ non-empty, disjoint subsets $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k$ such that the sum of the elements in each subset is the same, i.e., $\sum_{a \in A_i} a = \sum_{a \in A_j} a$ for all $1 \leq i, j \leq k$.
\end{definition}

The k-Partition problem is known to be strongly NP-hard, meaning that it remains NP-hard even when the input numbers are represented in unary \cite{garey1979computers}.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for searching an unsorted database. Given a black-box function $f: \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$, the algorithm finds an input $x$ such that $f(x) = 1$ in $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries, where $N = 2^n$ is the size of the search space. This query complexity is optimal for quantum algorithms, as shown by Bennett et al. \cite{bennett1997strengths}.

Grover's Algorithm proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize a quantum register in an equal superposition of all possible input states: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}|x\rangle$.

    \item Apply the Grover iteration, consisting of an oracle query and a diffusion operator, $O(\sqrt{N})$ times.

    \item Measure the quantum register to obtain a solution $x$ such that $f(x) = 1$ with high probability.

\end{enumerate}

The key component of Grover's Algorithm is the Grover iteration, which amplifies the amplitude of the target solution states while suppressing the amplitude of the non-solution states. This amplification process allows the target solutions to be measured with high probability after $O(\sqrt{N})$ iterations.

In the next section, we describe our methodology for applying Grover's Algorithm to the k-Partition problem.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

In this section, we present our methodology for transforming the k-Partition problem into a suitable form for Grover's Algorithm and constructing an oracle for the problem.

Our approach involves the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Encode the k-Partition problem as a binary function $f: \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$, where $f(x) = 1$ if and only if the binary representation of $x$ corresponds to a valid k-partition.

    \item Construct a quantum oracle $U_f$ that implements the function $f$ on a quantum computer. This oracle should be reversible and satisfy the following equation: $U_f|x\rangle|y\rangle = |x\rangle|y \oplus f(x)\rangle$, where $\oplus$ denotes bitwise addition modulo 2.

    \item Apply Grover's Algorithm to the oracle $U_f$ to find a solution $x$ such that $f(x) = 1$ with high probability.

\end{enumerate}

In the following subsections, we provide details on each step of our methodology.

\subsection{Encoding the k-Partition Problem}

To encode the k-Partition problem as a binary function, we represent each partition $A_i$ as a binary vector $b_i = (b_{i1}, b_{i2}, \ldots, b_{in})$, where $b_{ij} = 1$ if $a_j \in A_i$ and $b_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. The concatenation of these binary vectors forms the binary representation of a partition: $x = (b_{11}, b_{12}, \ldots, b_{1n}, b_{21}, b_{22}, \ldots, b_{2n}, \ldots, b_{k1}, b_{k2}, \ldots, b_{kn})$. The search space of our problem is thus the set of all $k \times n$ binary matrices.

We define the function $f(x)$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \text{ represents a valid k-partition,} \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

A valid k-partition satisfies the following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each element $a_j$ is assigned to exactly one subset: $\sum_{i=1}^k b_{ij} = 1$ for all $1 \leq j \leq n$.

    \item The sum of the elements in each subset is the same: $\sum_{a \in A_i} a = \sum_{a \in A_j} a$ for all $1 \leq i,

\section{Representation of Values in R0 and R1}

In the context of the k-Partition problem, the values stored in registers R0 and R1 represent the two partitions of the given set. The k-Partition problem can be defined as determining whether a given set can be divided into k subsets such that the sum of the elements in each subset is equal. In this specific example, we consider the case where k = 2, and the given set consists of the first three natural numbers, i.e., $\{1, 2, 3\}$. The sum of the elements in each of the two partitions must be equal for the problem to have a valid solution.

\section{Algorithm Description}

The algorithm presented in this paper is implemented in ARM assembly language and is designed to decide if the given values in R0 and R1 provide a valid solution to the k-Partition problem without violating any of the specified constraints.

\subsection{Calculating the Total Sum}

The first step in the algorithm is to calculate the sum of the elements of the given set. In this case, the set contains the first three natural numbers, so the sum is $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$. This value is stored in register R2 using the MOV instruction:

\begin{verbatim}
MOV R2, #6
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Computing the Sum of R0 and R1}

The next step in the algorithm is to compute the sum of the values stored in registers R0 and R1, which represent the two partitions of the given set. The ADD instruction is used to perform this operation:

\begin{verbatim}
ADD R3, R0, R1
\end{verbatim}

The result of the addition is stored in register R3.

\subsection{Checking the Validity of the Partition}

To determine if the values in R0 and R1 provide a valid solution to the k-Partition problem, the sum of the partitions must be equal to the sum of the given set. To check this condition, the algorithm subtracts the sum of the set (stored in R2) from the sum of R0 and R1 (stored in R3):

\begin{verbatim}
SUB R4, R3, R2
\end{verbatim}

The result of the subtraction is stored in register R4. If the difference is zero, the partition is valid, and the k-Partition problem has a solution.

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

The final step of the algorithm is to set the ZERO PSR (Processor Status Register) flag based on the result of the subtraction. If the difference between the sum of the partitions (R3) and the sum of the given set (R2) is zero, the ZERO PSR flag should be set. To achieve this, the algorithm uses the MOV and TST instructions:

\begin{verbatim}
MOV R5, R4
TST R5, R4
\end{verbatim}

The MOV instruction is used to move the value of R4 to register R5, as per the constraint that a register cannot be used twice in an instruction. The TST instruction then performs a bitwise AND operation between the values in R4 and R5. If the result is zero, the ZERO PSR flag is set, indicating that the given partition is a valid solution to the k-Partition problem.

\section{Conclusion}

This ARM assembly algorithm effectively determines whether the values stored in registers R0 and R1 provide a valid solution to the k-Partition problem while adhering to the specified constraints. By efficiently performing operations on the input values and setting the ZERO PSR flag accordingly, the algorithm provides a simple and elegant solution to the problem.
