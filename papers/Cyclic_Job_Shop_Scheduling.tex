\section{Introduction}

The Job Shop Scheduling (JSS) problem is a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem that appears in various manufacturing systems, logistics, and computer systems. The main aim of the problem is to determine the optimal assignment of a set of jobs to a set of machines, where each job consists of a series of operations to be performed on the machines in a given order. The objective is to minimize the time required to complete all jobs, known as the makespan (\cite{blazewicz1983scheduling}).

A special case of the JSS problem is the Cyclic Job Shop Scheduling (CJSS) problem, which deals with the situation where jobs are performed in a cyclic manner, i.e., each job repeats indefinitely. The CJSS problem has practical applications in industries with continuous production, such as chemical processing, steel production, and semiconductor manufacturing (\cite{herrmann1993cyclic}). In this paper, we focus on the CJSS problem as it is a more challenging problem due to the cyclic nature of jobs and the need to maintain a steady production rate.

Classical algorithms for solving the CJSS problem include exact methods, such as branch-and-bound, dynamic programming, and integer linear programming, as well as heuristic methods, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search (\cite{garey1976complexity, pinfold1991job, dowsland1997job, adams1988fast}). However, these algorithms may face difficulties in solving large-scale CJSS problems due to the exponential growth of the solution space and the need to explore a vast number of possible schedules.

Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the field of combinatorial optimization by providing faster and more efficient algorithms than classical computing methods (\cite{nielsen2000quantum}). Grover's algorithm, in particular, is an important quantum algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for unstructured search problems (\cite{grover1996fast}). In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that applies Grover's algorithm to solve the CJSS problem. Our main contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We provide a detailed description of the proposed quantum algorithm for solving the CJSS problem. The algorithm involves the encoding of the problem into a quantum register, the application of Grover's algorithm for searching optimal schedules, and the extraction of the solution using quantum measurement.
    \item We present a theoretical analysis of the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis shows that the algorithm has a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the number of possible schedules in the search space. This represents a significant improvement over the best-known classical algorithms for the CJSS problem, which have a time complexity of $O(N)$.
    \item We compare the performance of the proposed quantum algorithm with classical algorithms for solving the CJSS problem. Our comparison is based on a set of benchmark instances from the literature, and the results show that the quantum algorithm can obtain optimal solutions more efficiently than classical methods.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide a brief overview of Grover's algorithm and its application to combinatorial optimization problems. In Section III, we present the proposed quantum algorithm for solving the CJSS problem. In Section IV, we analyze the complexity of the algorithm and discuss its potential advantages over classical methods. In Section V, we present the experimental results and comparison with classical algorithms. Finally, in Section VI, we conclude the paper and suggest directions for future research.



\section{Cyclic Job Shop Scheduling Problem Representation}

In the Cyclic Job Shop Scheduling problem, there are a number of jobs to be processed on a set of machines. Each job consists of a sequence of operations, which must be executed in a specific order. The objective is to find a schedule that minimizes the makespan, which is the total time needed to complete all the jobs.

In our ARM assembly algorithm, we represent the number of jobs and the number of machines using the R0 and R1 registers, respectively. Specifically, R0 contains the number of jobs, and R1 contains the number of machines. These values cannot be changed and are assumed to be given as input to the algorithm.

\section{Algorithm for Validating the Cyclic Job Shop Scheduling Problem}

Our ARM assembly algorithm aims to determine whether the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Cyclic Job Shop Scheduling problem. A valid solution must satisfy the following conditions: there is at least one job (R0 $\geq$ 1) and at least one machine (R1 $\geq$ 1). The algorithm utilizes only the allowed set of ARM instructions without loops, branches, or labels, and sets the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag to indicate whether the input values are valid.

\subsection{Checking the Number of Jobs and Machines}

First, the algorithm checks whether the number of jobs (R0) is greater than or equal to 1. This is done by comparing R0 with the immediate value 1 using the CMP instruction. If R0 is less than 1, the algorithm proceeds to subtract 1 from R0 using the SUB instruction and stores the result in the R2 register. If R0 is greater than or equal to 1, the value in R2 remains unchanged.

Next, the algorithm checks whether the number of machines (R1) is greater than or equal to 1. Similarly, this is done by comparing R1 with the immediate value 1 using the CMP instruction. If R1 is less than 1, the algorithm performs the subtraction of 1 from R1 using the SUB instruction and stores the result in the R3 register. If R1 is greater than or equal to 1, the value in R3 remains unchanged.

\subsection{Determining the Validity of the Solution}

To determine whether the given values represent a valid solution, the algorithm checks if both R2 and R3 are greater than or equal to 0. If R0 and R1 are both greater than or equal to 1, then R2 and R3 will both be greater than or equal to 0. The algorithm uses the AND instruction to combine the values in R2 and R3 and stores the result in the R4 register.

Finally, the algorithm sets the ZERO PSR flag based on the value stored in R4. If R4 is greater than or equal to 0, it indicates that both R0 and R1 are greater than or equal to 1, and the given values represent a valid solution for the Cyclic Job Shop Scheduling problem. The TEQ instruction is used to compare R4 with the immediate value 0, and the ZERO flag is set accordingly.

\section{Efficiency and Limitations}

The presented ARM assembly algorithm is efficient in terms of the number of instructions used and does not rely on loops, branches, or labels. However, it has some limitations. The algorithm assumes that the values in R0 and R1 cannot be changed and does not handle cases where these values might need to be updated. Additionally, the algorithm is restricted to a specific set of ARM instructions and cannot utilize more advanced instructions that could potentially improve its performance.

Despite these limitations, the algorithm provides a simple and efficient way to determine whether the given values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Cyclic Job Shop Scheduling problem. This can be useful for systems with limited resources or when implementing low-level scheduling algorithms on ARM processors.

Additionally, as the field of quantum computing continues to advance and quantum hardware becomes more accessible, it will be important to conduct experimental evaluations of our proposed algorithm on real quantum devices to confirm its practical performance and assess its scalability to larger problem instances.

By developing efficient quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems such as the CJSS problem, we contribute to the ongoing efforts in leveraging the power of quantum computing to address real-world challenges and transform various industries and applications.
