\section{Introduction}

The Minimum Clique Cover (MCC) problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that seeks to find the minimum number of cliques that cover all the vertices of a given graph. In other words, the goal is to partition the vertices of the graph into a minimum number of cliques, where a clique is a complete subgraph in which every two vertices are adjacent. The MCC problem has been extensively studied due to its numerous applications in a wide range of fields, such as computer science, operations research, biology, and social network analysis \cite{mcc_applications}.

Despite its practical importance, the MCC problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{np_hard}, which means that there is no known algorithm that can solve this problem efficiently for all possible instances. Consequently, a large number of heuristic and approximation algorithms have been developed in the literature to tackle the MCC problem in practice \cite{mcc_heuristics}. While these methods can provide good solutions for specific instances, they do not guarantee optimal solutions, and their performance may degrade as the size of the problem increases.

The advent of quantum computing has opened up new possibilities for solving complex optimization problems by exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics. In particular, Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996} has been shown to offer a quadratic speed-up over classical search algorithms for unsorted databases. This remarkable result has inspired researchers to investigate the potential of Grover's Algorithm for solving a variety of optimization problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem \cite{grover_tsp}, the Maximum Clique Problem \cite{grover_maxclique}, and the Minimum Vertex Cover Problem \cite{grover_mvc}.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for solving the MCC problem based on Grover's Algorithm. The main idea of the proposed approach is to transform the MCC problem into a search problem by encoding the solution space as a quantum database and then applying Grover's Algorithm to search for the optimal solution. To this end, we first construct an oracle function that recognizes valid solutions to the MCC problem and then use Grover's Algorithm to iteratively search for the minimum clique cover. We also provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, showing that it can achieve a significant speed-up compared to classical methods for solving the MCC problem.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we provide a brief overview of the relevant background on Grover's Algorithm and the MCC problem. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present the proposed algorithm for solving the MCC problem using Grover's Algorithm and describe its main components in detail. In Section \ref{sec:complexity}, we analyze the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and compare it with existing methods for the MCC problem. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we summarize the main findings of this study and discuss potential directions for future research.

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

In this section, we briefly review the key concepts related to Grover's Algorithm and the MCC problem that are necessary for understanding the proposed approach.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996} is a quantum search algorithm that can find a target element in an unsorted database with a quadratic speed-up over classical search algorithms. Given a database of $N$ elements and a target element $x$, the algorithm can find $x$ with a probability of at least $1/2$ in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, whereas a classical search algorithm would require $O(N)$ steps on average.

The main idea of Grover's Algorithm is to iteratively apply a quantum transformation called the Grover operator to an initial equal superposition state of all possible solutions. This transformation amplifies the amplitude of the target element while reducing the amplitudes of the other elements, eventually converging to a state where the target element has a high probability of being measured. The Grover operator can be constructed as the product of two reflection operators, one corresponding to the oracle function that recognizes the target element and the other corresponding to the equal superposition state. The optimal number of iterations required for the algorithm to succeed with high probability is approximately $\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$.

\subsection{Minimum Clique Cover Problem}

The Minimum Clique Cover (MCC) problem is a combinatorial optimization problem defined on an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. The objective is to find a partition of the vertices into a minimum number of cliques, where a clique is a complete subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

The MCC problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem as follows:

\begin{align}
\text{Minimize} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k \\
\text{Subject to} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^{K} x_{ik} \ge 1 \quad \forall i \in V \\
& x_{ik} \le w_k \quad \forall i \in V, \forall k \in \{1, \dots, K\} \\
& x_{ik} + x_{jk} \le 1 \quad \forall (i, j) \notin E, \forall k \in \{1, \dots, K\} \\
& x_{ik}, w_k \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i \in V, \forall k \in \{1, \dots, K\}
\end{align}

Here, $K$ is an upper bound on the number of cliques, $x_{ik}$ is a binary variable that indicates whether vertex $i$ belongs to clique $k$, and $w_k$ is a binary variable that indicates whether clique $k$ is used in the cover. The objective is to minimize the total weight of the cliques, subject to the constraints that each vertex must belong to at least one clique, each clique can include only adjacent vertices, and the cliques must be disjoint.

However, due to the NP-hardness of the MCC problem, solving this ILP formulation directly is computationally intractable for large instances, motivating the development of heuristic and approximation algorithms, as well as quantum computing-based approaches.

\section{Proposed Algorithm}\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we present the proposed algorithm for solving the MCC problem using Grover's Algorithm. The main idea of the proposed approach is to transform the MCC problem into a search problem by encoding the solution space as a quantum database and then applying Grover's Algorithm to search for the optimal solution. The key components of the algorithm are the encoding scheme for representing the solutions, the oracle function for recognizing valid solutions, and the implementation of Grover's Algorithm for searching the solution space.

\subsection{Solution Encoding}

To apply Grover's Algorithm to the MCC problem, we first need to represent the solutions as quantum states. We do this by encoding the binary variables $x_{ik}$ and $w_k$ from the ILP formulation as qubits in a quantum register. Specifically, we use $n = |V|$ qubits for the vertices, $m = K$ qubits for the cliques, and $n \times m$ qubits for the assignments, resulting in a total of $n + m + nm$ qubits.

The initial state of the quantum register is an equal superposition of all possible assignments, which can be prepared by applying Hadamard gates to each qubit:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_0} = \frac{1}{2^{(n+m+nm)/2}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{k=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \ket{i}\ket{k}\ket{j},
\end{equation}

where $\ket{i}$, $\ket{k}$, and $\ket{j}$ denote the qubits corresponding to the vertices, cliques, and assignments, respectively.

\subsection{Oracle Function}

The oracle function is a critical component of Grover's Algorithm, as it determines whether a given solution is valid or not. In the context of the MCC problem, the oracle function needs to check whether a given assignment of vertices to cliques satisfies the constraints of the ILP formulation.

To implement the oracle function, we use a series of quantum gates that perform the following operations:

1. Check whether each vertex is assigned to at least one clique, and store the result in an ancilla qubit.

2. Check whether each clique contains only adjacent vertices, and store the result in

\section{Representation of Graph in Registers R0 and R1}

In this example, we consider a graph with three vertices for the Minimum Clique Cover problem. R0 and R1 are used to represent the adjacency matrix of the graph as two binary numbers. The adjacency matrix is a 3x3 matrix where the value at position (i, j) is 1 if there is an edge between vertices i and j, and 0 otherwise. Since the diagonal of the matrix is always 0, we only need to store the upper triangular part of the matrix as binary numbers, which can be represented by 3 bits. Therefore, R0 contains the first row of the upper triangular part, and R1 contains the second row.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

The primary goal of the algorithm is to determine if the given graph is a clique (completely connected) or can be covered by two cliques. If the graph is a clique, then the upper triangular part of the adjacency matrix will have all 1's. If the graph can be covered by two cliques, then there should be at least one 0 in the upper triangular part, and for each 0, the corresponding bit in the other row should be 1.

The algorithm proceeds in the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Check if the graph is a clique by testing if all bits are set in both R0 and R1.
    \item Check if the graph can be covered by two cliques by inverting the values in R0 and R1, and then combining the inverted values with the original values.
    \item Set the ZERO PSR flag if the graph is a valid solution by combining the results from the previous steps and comparing the combined result with 0.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Algorithm Implementation in ARM Assembly}

The algorithm is implemented in ARM assembly language using the available instructions, adhering to the constraints provided. The assembly code begins with loading R0 and R1 with the adjacency matrix of the example graph, using the MOV instruction. Then, the algorithm checks if the graph is a clique by testing if all bits are set in both R0 and R1 using the TST instruction. The results are combined using the AND instruction and stored in R3.

To check if the graph can be covered by two cliques, the BIC instruction is used to invert the values in R0 and R1, creating R4 and R5, respectively. The inverted values are then combined with the original values in R1 and R0 using the AND instruction, resulting in registers R6 and R7. The ORR instruction is then used to combine the results from R6 and R7, and the combined result is stored in R8.

Finally, the algorithm sets the ZERO PSR flag if the graph is a valid solution. This is done by combining the results from R3 and R8 using the ORR instruction, creating R9. The TEQ instruction is then used to set the ZERO PSR flag by comparing the value of R9 with 0.

\section{Efficiency Considerations}

The assembly code is designed to be efficient in terms of the number of instructions used and the number of registers utilized. The algorithm does not use any branches, loops, or labels, which ensures that the code runs in a linear fashion without any jumps. Moreover, each register is used only once, and a register is not used twice in an instruction, adhering to the constraints provided.

The code is optimized for a limited computer system by using a small number of registers and instructions. This approach makes the code suitable for running on an ARM processor with limited resources and ensures that the algorithm is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

In summary, the ARM assembly code provided implements an efficient algorithm for determining if the values in registers R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Minimum Clique Cover problem for a 3-vertex graph. The code adheres to the constraints provided and is designed to run efficiently on an ARM processor with limited resources.
