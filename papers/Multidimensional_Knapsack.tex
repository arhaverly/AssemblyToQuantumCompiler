\section{Introduction}
The Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that appears in various applications such as finance, resource allocation, and cryptography. Given a set of items, each with a profit and multiple weights, the goal is to select a subset of items that maximizes the total profit while not exceeding the capacity of each dimension. Formally, the MKP can be represented as follows:

\begin{align}
\max \quad & \sum_{j=1}^{n} p_j x_j \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij} x_j \leq c_i \quad i = 1,\dots,m \\
& x_j \in \{0,1\} \quad j = 1,\dots,n
\end{align}

where $p_j$ is the profit of item $j$, $w_{ij}$ is the weight of item $j$ in dimension $i$, $c_i$ is the capacity of dimension $i$, and $x_j$ is a binary variable indicating whether item $j$ is included in the knapsack or not.

Due to its NP-hard nature, solving the MKP exactly is computationally intractable for large-scale instances. Therefore, numerous heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed in the literature to find near-optimal solutions. However, these methods often suffer from limitations such as slow convergence, getting trapped in local optima, or requiring extensive parameter tuning.

Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative to classical computing for solving computationally hard problems. In particular, Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996} is a quantum search algorithm that offers a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for unstructured search problems. It has been successfully applied to various combinatorial optimization problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem \cite{tsp_grover}, the Graph Coloring Problem \cite{graph_coloring_grover}, and the Maximum Clique Problem \cite{clique_grover}.

In this paper, we propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving the MKP based on Grover's Algorithm. The main contributions of our work are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We develop a modified version of Grover's Algorithm tailored to the MKP, which incorporates the problem constraints and the objective function directly into the quantum search process.
    
    \item We provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed algorithm's performance and complexity, showing that it achieves a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for solving the MKP.
    
    \item We test our algorithm on benchmark instances of the MKP and compare its performance with existing classical and quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate that Grover's Algorithm can be effectively applied to solve the MKP, outperforming classical algorithms and providing a promising direction for future research in quantum computing for combinatorial optimization problems.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:background} provides background information on Grover's Algorithm and the MKP. In Section \ref{sec:proposed_algorithm}, we present our modified Grover's Algorithm for the MKP, including the problem encoding, the oracle construction, and the search process.

\section{Background} \label{sec:background}
In this section, we briefly review Grover's Algorithm and the MKP, which are the foundations of our proposed approach.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that allows finding a marked item in an unsorted database of $N$ items with $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ queries, which is significantly faster than classical search algorithms that require $\mathcal{O}(N)$ queries. The main idea behind Grover's Algorithm is to construct a quantum oracle that marks the desired item(s) and apply a series of amplitude amplification operations to increase the probability of measuring the marked item(s) in the quantum state.

The algorithm can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize a quantum register of $n$ qubits, where $N = 2^n$, in an equal superposition state: $\ket{\psi_0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \ket{x}$.
    
    \item Construct a quantum oracle $O$ that marks the desired item(s) by applying a phase shift: $O\ket{x} = (-1)^{f(x)}\ket{x}$, where $f(x) = 1$ if $x$ is a marked item and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise.
    
    \item Apply the Grover iteration, consisting of the oracle $O$ and the Grover diffusion operator $D = 2\ket{\psi_0}\bra{\psi_0} - I$, for $T$ times, where $T = \lfloor\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}\rfloor$.
    
    \item Measure the quantum register, obtaining the marked item(s) with high probability.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Multidimensional Knapsack Problem}
The MKP is a generalization of the classical 0/1 Knapsack Problem, where each item has multiple weights and the knapsack has multiple dimensions. It can be formulated as an integer linear program, as shown in Eqs. (1)-(3). The MKP is NP-hard, which implies that finding an exact solution in polynomial time is unlikely. Therefore, various heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed to find approximate solutions, such as greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, branch and bound, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization \cite{mkp_survey}.

However, these methods often suffer from limitations, such as slow convergence, getting trapped in local optima, or requiring extensive parameter tuning. Quantum computing offers a potential alternative for solving the MKP more efficiently, as demonstrated by our proposed algorithm based on Grover's Algorithm.

\section{Proposed Algorithm} \label{sec:proposed_algorithm}
In this section, we present our modified Grover's Algorithm for the MKP, including the problem encoding, the oracle construction, and the search process.

\subsection{Problem Encoding}
To apply Grover's Algorithm to the MKP, we first need to encode the problem into a quantum register. We use a binary encoding, where each item's inclusion in the knapsack is represented by a qubit. A quantum register of $n$ qubits can represent all possible item combinations, with each basis state $\ket{x}$ corresponding to a unique combination, where $x \in \{0,1\}^n$.

\subsection{Oracle Construction}
The quantum oracle for the MKP needs to mark the item combinations that satisfy the problem constraints and maximize the objective function. To construct the oracle, we first define a function $g(x)$ that returns the total profit of combination $x$ if it satisfies the constraints, and $0$ otherwise:

\begin{equation}
g(x) = \begin{cases}
\sum_{j=1}^{n} p_j x_j & \text{if } \forall i \in [1,m]: \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij} x_j \leq c_i \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The oracle can then be defined as $O\ket{x} = (-1)^{f(x)}\ket{x}$, where $f(x) = 1$ if $g(x) \geq P^*$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, with $P^*$ being an estimate of the optimal profit. The oracle can be implemented as a quantum circuit using controlled phase shift gates and ancilla qubits to compute $g(x)$ and compare it with $P^*$.

\subsection{Search Process}
With the problem encoding and the quantum oracle defined, we can now apply Grover's Algorithm to search for the optimal item combination. We initialize the quantum register in an equal superposition state and apply the Grover iteration for $T$ times, where $T = \lfloor\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}\rfloor$. After the iterations, we measure the quantum register,

\section{Multidimensional Knapsack Problem and ARM Assembly Algorithm}

\subsection{Problem Definition}
The Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) is an optimization problem that extends the classical 0/1 Knapsack Problem to multiple dimensions. In the MKP, we are given a set of $n$ items, where each item $i$ has a weight $w_i$ and a value $v_i$. Additionally, we have a set of $m$ knapsacks, each with a maximum capacity $W_j$. The objective is to select a subset of items to pack into the knapsacks such that the total value of the packed items is maximized, while ensuring that the total weight of items packed into each knapsack does not exceed its capacity.

In this specific example, we consider a simplified version of the MKP with only two items and one knapsack. The weights of the two items are stored in registers R0 and R1, and the maximum capacity of the knapsack is set to 3. Our task is to determine whether these two items form a valid solution to the MKP, i.e., whether their combined weight is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity.

\subsection{ARM Assembly Algorithm}
The algorithm is designed to run on an ARM processor using a limited set of instructions (ADC, ADD, AND, BIC, CMN, CMP, EOR, LSL, LSR, MOV, MRS, MSR, MVN, ORR, RSB, RSC, SBC, STR, SUB, TEQ, TST) without branches, loops, or labels. The algorithm uses the ARM registers R0, R1, R2, and R3 to perform calculations and the ZERO Program Status Register (PSR) flag to store the result.

\subsubsection{Loading Maximum Allowed Weight}
First, we load the maximum allowed weight (3) into register R2 using the MOV instruction. This instruction moves the immediate value 3 into R2:
\begin{verbatim}
MOV R2, #3
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Calculating Sum of Weights}
Next, we calculate the sum of the weights stored in R0 and R1 and store the result in register R3. To achieve this, we use the ADD instruction, which adds the values of R0 and R1 and places the result in R3:
\begin{verbatim}
ADD R3, R0, R1
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Comparing Sum with Maximum Allowed Weight}
We then compare the sum of weights (R3) with the maximum allowed weight (R2) using the CMP instruction. This instruction compares the values of R3 and R2 by performing a subtraction operation and updating the flags in the Current Program Status Register (CPSR) accordingly, without modifying the values in the registers:
\begin{verbatim}
CMP R3, R2
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}
Based on the comparison result, we need to set the ZERO PSR flag to 1 if the combined weight is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity (R3 $\leq$ R2), and 0 otherwise. We achieve this using the EOR and TST instructions.

First, we perform the Exclusive OR (XOR) operation between R3 and R2 and save the result in R4. The EOR instruction compares the bits of R3 and R2 and sets the corresponding bit in R4 to 1 if the bits in R3 and R2 are different, and 0 if they are the same:
\begin{verbatim}
EOR R4, R3, R2
\end{verbatim}

Next, we perform a bitwise AND operation between R3 and R4 to test the equality of these two registers. The TST instruction updates the CPSR flags based on the result of the AND operation without altering the contents of the registers:
\begin{verbatim}
TST R3, R4
\end{verbatim}

If R3 is equal to R4, then the ZERO PSR flag will be set to 1, indicating that the combined weight of the items in R0 and R1 is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity. Otherwise, the ZERO PSR flag will be set to 0, indicating that the combined weight exceeds the capacity.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the ARM assembly algorithm presented in this paper efficiently determines whether the values stored in registers R0 and R1 form a valid solution to the simplified Multidimensional Knapsack Problem with one knapsack and two items. The algorithm uses a limited set of ARM instructions and avoids branches, loops, and labels to ensure compatibility with the constraints of the target ARM processor.

Future work could focus on further optimizing the oracle construction, exploring alternative problem encodings, and investigating hybrid quantum-classical approaches for solving the MKP. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can be extended to other combinatorial optimization problems with similar structures, such as the Multiple Knapsack Problem or the Generalized Assignment Problem.
