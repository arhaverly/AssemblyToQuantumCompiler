% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The Bandwidth Minimization problem (BMP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that has been widely studied due to its practical applications in various fields such as parallel computing, VLSI design, and compiler optimization \cite{bmp_applications}. The goal of the BMP is to find an optimal linear arrangement of the vertices of a given graph such that the maximum difference between the indices of adjacent vertices is minimized. The problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{bmp_nphard}, and its exact solutions are computationally expensive to obtain using classical algorithms.

Quantum computing has emerged as a promising technology to address complex problems that are difficult to solve with classical computing methods. One of the most renowned quantum algorithms is Grover's Algorithm, which has been proven to provide a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms in unstructured search problems \cite{grover}. This paper leverages the power of Grover's Algorithm to develop a new approach for solving the BMP efficiently.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

This section provides an overview of the Bandwidth Minimization problem and Grover's Algorithm, which are the main building blocks of the proposed quantum algorithm.

\subsection{Bandwidth Minimization Problem}
\label{subsec:bmp}

Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the Bandwidth Minimization problem seeks to find a permutation of the vertices $\pi: V \rightarrow \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ such that the bandwidth $b(G)$ is minimized. The bandwidth of the graph is defined as the maximum difference between the indices of adjacent vertices, i.e.,

\begin{equation}
b(G) = \max_{(u, v) \in E} |\pi(u) - \pi(v)|.
\end{equation}

The BMP has numerous practical applications, including minimizing communication overhead in parallel computing, optimizing wirelength in VLSI design, and reducing cache misses in compilers \cite{bmp_applications}. Despite its importance, the BMP has been proven to be NP-hard \cite{bmp_nphard}, and finding exact solutions is computationally challenging.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
\label{subsec:grover}

Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover} is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for unstructured search problems. Given a search space of size $N$ and a black-box function $f$ that marks the target elements, Grover's Algorithm can find a marked element with high probability using $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries to $f$. The algorithm is based on the principles of quantum computing, leveraging quantum superposition and interference to efficiently search the solution space.

The core components of Grover's Algorithm are the Grover iteration (or Grover operator) and the amplitude amplification technique. The Grover iteration consists of two main steps: the oracle application and the Grover diffusion operator. The oracle encodes the problem's structure and is responsible for marking the target elements, while the Grover diffusion operator amplifies the probability amplitudes of the marked elements, making them more likely to be measured. The Grover iteration is applied repeatedly, approximately $\sqrt{N}$ times, to maximize the probability of finding a marked element.

\section{Quantum Algorithm for the Bandwidth Minimization Problem}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we describe the proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Bandwidth Minimization problem, which is based on Grover's Algorithm. The main idea is to encode the BMP into a suitable oracle function and employ Grover's search to efficiently explore the space of vertex orderings to find the optimal solution.

\section{Problem Definition}

In the context of the Bandwidth Minimization problem, we assume that R0 and R1 represent the distances of two nodes in a graph. The goal of the problem is to minimize the sum of distances between these nodes while satisfying given constraints. In this case, the largest allowed sum is 3.

\section{ARM Assembly Algorithm}

To decide if the values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution to the Bandwidth Minimization problem, we have developed an ARM assembly code that efficiently checks if the sum of these values is less than or equal to 3. The algorithm uses a limited set of instructions and adheres to strict conditions to ensure optimal performance on a constrained computer system. The following sections detail the ARM assembly code and its underlying principles.

\subsection{Algorithm Overview}

The assembly code comprises three main steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate the sum of R0 and R1, storing the result in R2.
    \item Subtract R2 from 3 and store the result in R3.
    \item Compare R3 to 0 and set the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag accordingly.
\end{enumerate}

The ZERO PSR flag is set to 1 if the values in R0 and R1 are a solution (i.e., their sum is less than or equal to 3), and 0 if they are not a solution.

\subsection{Step-by-step Explanation}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Calculate the Sum}

In the first step, we calculate the sum of the values stored in registers R0 and R1 using the ADD instruction:

\begin{verbatim}
ADD R2, R0, R1
\end{verbatim}

The result is stored in register R2.

\subsubsection{Step 2: Subtract the Sum from 3}

Next, we subtract the sum stored in R2 from the given maximum value (3) using the RSB (Reverse Subtract) instruction:

\begin{verbatim}
RSB R3, R2, #3
\end{verbatim}

This operation effectively checks if the sum of R0 and R1 is less than or equal to 3. If the result stored in R3 is non-negative, this indicates that the sum is within the allowed range and thus represents a valid solution.

\subsubsection{Step 3: Set the ZERO PSR Flag}

Finally, we compare the value in R3 to 0 using the CMP (Compare) instruction:

\begin{verbatim}
CMP R3, #0
\end{verbatim}

This instruction sets the ZERO PSR flag to 1 if R3 is greater than or equal to 0, indicating a valid solution. If R3 is negative, the ZERO PSR flag is set to 0, indicating an invalid solution.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our ARM assembly algorithm provides an efficient and effective means of determining whether the values in registers R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Bandwidth Minimization problem. By calculating the sum of the given values, comparing it to the maximum allowed value, and setting the ZERO PSR flag accordingly, we can quickly and accurately classify the input values as either a valid or invalid solution.
