\section{Introduction}

Project Scheduling is a fundamental aspect of project management, involving the assignment of tasks to resources and the determination of their start and end times, subject to various constraints. These constraints may include resource availability, task dependencies, and deadlines. The primary goal of Project Scheduling is to minimize the overall duration of the project, also known as the makespan, while satisfying all constraints \cite{pinedo2012scheduling}. This problem has been extensively studied in the literature, and various algorithms have been developed to address it, including the Critical Path Method (CPM) and the Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) \cite{kelley1961critical, fondahl1961non}.

Despite the significant improvements in the development of scheduling algorithms, the Project Scheduling problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization problem, particularly for large-scale projects involving numerous tasks and resources. The complexity of the problem increases exponentially with the number of tasks and resources, rendering classical algorithms inefficient for solving large instances \cite{kolisch2006survey}. Consequently, there is a growing interest in exploring alternative computational paradigms, such as quantum computing, which has demonstrated potential advantages over classical computing in terms of computational speed and efficiency.

Quantum computing exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in a fundamentally different way than classical computing \cite{nielsen2010quantum}. Quantum bits, or qubits, have the unique ability to exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously, enabling the parallel execution of operations, which leads to significant speedup for certain problems. One such problem is unstructured search, for which Grover's Algorithm, a quantum search algorithm, has been developed \cite{grover1996fast}. Grover's Algorithm can search an unsorted database of $N$ elements in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ time, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the Project Scheduling problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our method leverages the inherent speedup capabilities of quantum computing to efficiently search the solution space, reducing the computational complexity while retaining the accuracy and optimality of the solutions. The main contributions of this paper are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We develop a quantum algorithm based on Grover's Algorithm to solve the Project Scheduling problem.

\end{itemize}

\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide an overview of the Project Scheduling problem, quantum computing concepts, and Grover's Algorithm.

\subsection{Project Scheduling Problem}

The Project Scheduling problem can be formally defined as follows: Given a set of tasks $T = \{t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n\}$, a set of resources $R = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_m\}$, and a set of constraints $C$, the objective is to find a schedule $S$ that assigns each task $t_i$ to a resource $r_j$ and determines its start and end times, such that the makespan is minimized while satisfying all constraints in $C$.

The constraints in $C$ can be classified into three main categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resource constraints}: Each resource $r_j$ has a limited availability, and the total demand for $r_j$ by all tasks assigned to it must not exceed its capacity.
    \item \textbf{Precedence constraints}: Each task $t_i$ may have a set of predecessor tasks that must be completed before $t_i$ can start. This is denoted as $pred(t_i) \subseteq T$.
    \item \textbf{Time constraints}: Each task $t_i$ may have a deadline $d_i$ by which it must be completed. Additionally, each task $t_i$ has a duration $p_i$, representing the time required to complete the task.
\end{itemize}

The Project Scheduling problem is known to be NP-hard, implying that there is no known algorithm that can solve it in polynomial time for all instances \cite{blazewicz1983scheduling}.

\subsection{Quantum Computing Concepts}

Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which allows for the representation and manipulation of information using quantum bits or qubits. Unlike classical bits, which can only store either a 0 or a 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 states simultaneously, denoted as $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, respectively. The state of a qubit can be represented as a linear combination of these basis states:

\[ |\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle \]

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex amplitudes, and $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. This superposition property allows quantum computers to perform multiple operations in parallel, potentially leading to significant speedup for certain problems.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm developed by Lov K. Grover in 1996 \cite{grover1996fast}. The algorithm is designed to search an unsorted database of $N$ elements for a target element with a known property. Grover's Algorithm can find the target element with high probability in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ time, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms.

The algorithm consists of two main components: an oracle, which encodes the target element's property, and a Grover iterator, which amplifies the amplitude of the target element in the quantum state. The algorithm iteratively applies the Grover iterator to the initial state, progressively increasing the probability of measuring the target element. After approximately $\sqrt{N}$ iterations, the target element can be found with high probability.

\section{Proposed Algorithm} \label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we detail the proposed algorithm for solving the Project Scheduling problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our approach consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Encode the Project Scheduling problem instance into a quantum state.
    \item Design an oracle to recognize feasible schedules with a makespan below a given threshold.
    \item Implement the Grover iterator to amplify the amplitude of feasible schedules.
    \item Perform Grover's Algorithm to search for a feasible schedule with a minimal makespan.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Encoding the Problem Instance}

The first step in our approach is to encode the Project Scheduling problem instance into a quantum state. This involves assigning a unique binary representation to each possible schedule, considering task-to-resource assignments and task start times. We then construct a quantum register with sufficient qubits to represent all possible schedules, initializing it to a uniform superposition of all basis states.

\subsection{Oracle Design}

The oracle is responsible for recognizing feasible schedules with a makespan below a given threshold. To achieve this, we design a set of quantum circuits that represent the resource, precedence, and time constraints of the problem. The oracle checks each constraint in parallel and marks the schedules that satisfy all constraints by flipping the phase of their corresponding quantum states.

\subsection{Grover Iterator Implementation}

The Grover iterator amplifies the amplitude of feasible schedules in the quantum state. It consists of two main operations: the application of the oracle, followed by the application of a diffusion operator. The diffusion operator inverts the amplitudes of all states about the mean amplitude, effectively amplifying the amplitude of feasible schedules while reducing the amplitude of infeasible ones.

\subsection{Performing Grover's Algorithm}

Finally, we perform Grover's Algorithm to search for a feasible schedule with a minimal makespan. The algorithm iteratively applies the Grover iterator to the initial

\section{Problem Representation}

In this example, we consider the Project Scheduling problem, where the main goal is to determine if a project is complete based on the number of tasks completed and the total number of tasks in the project. We represent these two values using registers R0 and R1, where R0 stores the number of tasks completed and R1 stores the total number of tasks. The Project Scheduling problem can be stated as follows: given the values in R0 and R1, determine if the project is complete by checking if the number of tasks completed is equal to the total number of tasks.

\section{Algorithm Description}

Our proposed algorithm aims to solve the Project Scheduling problem using ARM assembly code without loops and with a limited set of instructions. The algorithm compares the values stored in R0 and R1 and sets the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag accordingly. A value of 1 in the ZERO PSR flag indicates that the project is complete, and a value of 0 indicates that the project is not complete. The algorithm comprises the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate the difference between the values stored in R1 and R0, which represents the difference between the total number of tasks and the number of tasks completed. Store the result in register R2.
    \item Check if the difference stored in R2 is equal to 0. If it is, the project is complete, and we set the ZERO PSR flag to 1. Otherwise, we set the flag to 0.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Algorithm Implementation}

The ARM assembly code implementation of the algorithm is described below. The implementation adheres to the specified constraints, such as not using loops and restricted instruction set.

\subsection{Initial Values}

The algorithm assumes that the values in R0 and R1 are given as input, where R0 stores the number of tasks completed and R1 stores the total number of tasks. We do not need to initialize these registers in our assembly code, as they are considered unmodifiable.

\subsection{Calculating the Difference}

To calculate the difference between the total number of tasks (R1) and the number of tasks completed (R0), we use the SUB instruction. The result is stored in register R2. The SUB instruction subtracts the value in R0 from the value in R1 and stores the result in R2:

\begin{verbatim}
    SUB R2, R1, R0
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Comparing the Difference and Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

Next, we need to check if the difference stored in R2 is equal to 0. If the difference is 0, it means that the project is complete and the number of tasks completed is equal to the total number of tasks. To compare the difference with 0, we use the CMP instruction. The CMP instruction compares the value in R2 with the immediate value 0:

\begin{verbatim}
    CMP R2, #0
\end{verbatim}

The CMP instruction sets the ZERO PSR flag based on the comparison result. If the difference is equal to 0, the ZERO PSR flag is set to 1, indicating that the project is complete. If the difference is not equal to 0, the ZERO PSR flag is set to 0, indicating that the project is not complete.

\section{Algorithm Complexity and Efficiency}

The proposed algorithm has a constant time complexity, as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input values. This makes the algorithm highly efficient for the given problem, as it does not involve loops or branches, which could increase the complexity and decrease the efficiency of the algorithm. The algorithm is also efficient in terms of register usage, as it only uses three registers (R0, R1, and R2) and meets all the specified constraints for register usage.
