\section{Introduction}
The Minimum Multiway Cut problem is a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem with numerous applications in computer networks, VLSI design, and computational biology, among others. Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with non-negative edge weights and a set of terminal vertices $T \subseteq V$, the goal is to find a minimum-weight set of edges whose removal separates the terminal vertices into disjoint connected components. The problem is a generalization of the Minimum Cut problem, which has only two terminal vertices, and has been proven to be NP-hard \cite{dahlhaus1994complexity}. As a result, classical algorithms to solve the Minimum Multiway Cut problem are often computationally expensive, especially for large-scale graphs.

Quantum computing has demonstrated the potential to solve certain classes of problems more efficiently than classical computing, and Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is one such example. Grover's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for unstructured search problems. The algorithm's ability to search through a large solution space efficiently makes it a promising candidate for tackling combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Minimum Multiway Cut problem.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that combines Grover's Algorithm with classical techniques to solve the Minimum Multiway Cut problem. We first transform the problem into an equivalent decision problem and then use Grover's Algorithm to search for a solution. We also introduce a classical subroutine to generate candidate solutions, which we then evaluate using Grover's Algorithm. The proposed algorithm leverages the quadratic speedup of Grover's Algorithm to significantly reduce the time complexity of solving the Minimum Multiway Cut problem.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We present a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for solving the Minimum Multiway Cut problem, utilizing Grover's Algorithm to achieve a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms.

    \item We discuss the implementation of the proposed algorithm on a quantum computer and the challenges associated with it.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:background} provides background information on Grover's Algorithm and the Minimum Multiway Cut problem. In Section \ref{sec:proposed_algorithm}, we present the proposed algorithm, discuss its implementation, and analyze its time complexity. Section \ref{sec:discussion} discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm and the challenges associated with its implementation on a quantum computer. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
In this section, we provide an overview of Grover's Algorithm and the Minimum Multiway Cut problem. We also discuss related work on using quantum algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
Grover's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm developed by Lov Grover in 1996 \cite{grover1996fast}. It is designed to search an unsorted database of $N$ items for a marked item, given a black-box function $f$ that can identify the marked item. The algorithm can find the marked item with a high probability using $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ queries to the function $f$, compared to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ queries required by classical algorithms. This quadratic speedup has potential applications in various combinatorial optimization problems, where the solution space can be searched more efficiently using Grover's Algorithm.

\subsection{Minimum Multiway Cut Problem}
The Minimum Multiway Cut problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that seeks to partition a given undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with non-negative edge weights into multiple disjoint connected components while minimizing the sum of the weights of the edges removed. The problem can be formally defined as follows:

\begin{quote}
Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with non-negative edge weights $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ and a set of terminal vertices $T \subseteq V$, find a minimum-weight set of edges $F \subseteq E$ such that the removal of $F$ results in a graph $G'=(V,E \setminus F)$ with the terminal vertices in disjoint connected components.
\end{quote}

The Minimum Multiway Cut problem is a generalization of the Minimum Cut problem and has been proven to be NP-hard \cite{dahlhaus1994complexity}. Several classical algorithms have been developed to solve the problem, including approximation algorithms \cite{karger1995randomized, dahlhaus2000approximation} and exact algorithms \cite{goldschmidt1994polyhedra, chopra1993polyhedra}. However, these algorithms are often computationally expensive, especially for large-scale graphs.

\subsection{Quantum Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization}
Quantum computing has shown promise in solving certain classes of combinatorial optimization problems more efficiently than classical computing. Grover's Algorithm, in particular, has been applied to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem \cite{ambainis2000quantum}, the Maximum Clique problem \cite{cheng2005quantum}, and the Graph Coloring problem \cite{childs2002quantum}. These studies demonstrate the potential of using Grover's Algorithm to achieve significant speedup over classical algorithms in solving combinatorial optimization problems.

\section{Problem Definition}

In the context of this research, the Minimum Multiway Cut problem is represented by two given values stored in registers R0 and R1. These values represent the edges' weights in a graph, and our task is to determine whether these edge weights provide a valid solution to the Minimum Multiway Cut problem. A valid solution is one where the sum of the edge weights is less than or equal to a specified threshold, in this case, 3. The solution must be determined using ARM assembly code without loops and adhering to the specific set of instructions provided.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

To find the solution, an ARM assembly algorithm without loops is designed, using the allowed set of instructions. The algorithm comprises three main steps: adding the values of R0 and R1, subtracting a constant from the result, and testing the final result against zero. The result is stored in the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag. If the flag is set to 1, the values in R0 and R1 provide a valid solution; otherwise, the flag is set to 0, indicating an invalid solution.

\section{Algorithm Description}

In this section, we describe the algorithm in detail, explaining each step of the process and the rationale behind the choices made.

\subsection{Adding the values in R0 and R1}

The first step of the algorithm is to add the values stored in registers R0 and R1. These values represent the edges' weights in the graph, and the sum of these weights will be used to determine if they provide a valid solution for the Minimum Multiway Cut problem. The following ARM assembly instruction is used for this step:

\begin{verbatim}
ADD R2, R0, R1
\end{verbatim}

This instruction adds the values of R0 and R1 and stores the result in register R2. Since the largest number allowed in this example is 3, we know that the sum of the edge weights can range from 0 to 6. The result in R2 will be used in the subsequent steps of the algorithm.

\subsection{Subtracting a constant from the result}

The second step of the algorithm is to subtract a constant value from the result stored in R2. The constant value is chosen as 4, allowing us to determine if the sum of the edge weights is less than or equal to 3. Subtracting 4 from the result will ensure that the final result is either zero or negative if the sum of the edge weights is less than or equal to 3. The following ARM assembly instruction is used for this step:

\begin{verbatim}
SUB R3, R2, #4
\end{verbatim}

This instruction subtracts 4 from the value stored in R2 and stores the result in register R3. The result in R3 will be used in the final step of the algorithm to set the ZERO PSR flag.

\subsection{Testing the final result against zero}

The final step of the algorithm is to test the result in R3 against zero. This test will set the ZERO PSR flag to 1 if the result is equal to zero, indicating that the sum of the edge weights in R0 and R1 is less than or equal to 3 and therefore provides a valid solution to the Minimum Multiway Cut problem. If the result is not equal to zero, the ZERO PSR flag will be set to 0, indicating an invalid solution. The following ARM assembly instruction is used for this step:

\begin{verbatim}
TST R3, #0
\end{verbatim}

This instruction tests the value in R3 against zero and sets the ZERO PSR flag accordingly. The final value of the flag will indicate whether the values in R0 and R1 provide a valid solution to the Minimum Multiway Cut problem.

\section{Conclusion}

In this research, we have presented an ARM assembly algorithm without loops that efficiently determines if the given values in R0 and R1 provide a valid solution to the Minimum Multiway Cut problem. The algorithm uses a specific set of instructions and adheres to the imposed constraints, making it suitable for implementation on a limited-capability ARM processor. The result of the algorithm is stored in the ZERO PSR flag, providing a clear indication of whether the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid or invalid solution.
