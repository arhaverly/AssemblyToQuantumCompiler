\section{Introduction}

The Weighted Set Packing problem (WSP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem, which has been extensively studied due to its applications in multiple domains, such as computer science, operations research, and economics. Given a collection of weighted sets, the objective of the WSP is to find the maximum weight subcollection of pairwise disjoint sets. The WSP is a generalization of the well-known Set Packing problem, and it is known to be NP-hard \cite{garey1979computers}, which implies that efficient classical algorithms for solving the WSP are unlikely to exist.

Quantum computing offers promising opportunities for solving complex optimization problems, such as the WSP, by exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers. In recent years, several quantum algorithms have been proposed to tackle various combinatorial optimization problems \cite{farhi2014quantum, kitaev2002classical}, with some offering significant speedup over classical techniques. One such algorithm is Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast}, which provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for unstructured search problems.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the WSP using Grover's Algorithm. Our approach is based on a systematic encoding of the WSP's combinatorial structure into an oracle function that can be effectively queried by Grover's Algorithm. By leveraging the quantum speedup provided by Grover's Algorithm, our method significantly reduces the time complexity of solving the WSP when compared to classical techniques. We provide a rigorous analysis of our algorithm's computational complexity, scalability, and potential for further optimization.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section \ref{sec:background}, we provide an overview of the WSP, Grover's Algorithm, and their relevance to the field of quantum computing. In Section \ref{sec:encoding}, we describe our method for encoding the WSP's combinatorial structure into an oracle function that can be queried by Grover's Algorithm. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present our quantum algorithm for solving the WSP based on Grover's Algorithm, and we provide a detailed complexity analysis. In Section \ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss the implications of our findings for the future of quantum computing in combinatorial optimization and outline potential avenues for further research. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper by summarizing our main contributions and results.

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Weighted Set Packing Problem}

The Weighted Set Packing problem (WSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that can be formally defined as follows: Given a collection of $n$ weighted sets $\mathcal{S} = \{S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n\}$, where each set $S_i$ is associated with a positive weight $w_i$, the goal is to find a subcollection $\mathcal{S'} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ of pairwise disjoint sets (i.e., $S_i \cap S_j = \emptyset$ for all $S_i, S_j \in \mathcal{S'}$, $i \neq j$) that maximizes the sum of the weights of the sets in $\mathcal{S'}$. The WSP is a generalization of the Set Packing problem, where all sets have equal weight.

The WSP has numerous applications in various fields, such as scheduling, resource allocation, and network design \cite{korte2000combinatorial}. Due to its NP-hardness, several approximation algorithms have been proposed to solve the WSP in polynomial time \cite{hochbaum1997approximation}. However, these algorithms typically provide suboptimal solutions, and their performance guarantees depend on the structural properties of the input instances.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that was proposed by Lov Grover in 1996 \cite{grover1996fast}. The algorithm is designed to search for a marked item in an unsorted database of $N$ items with a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. Specifically, Grover's Algorithm can find the marked item with a probability of at least $1/2$ in $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries to an oracle function, whereas classical algorithms require $O(N)$ queries in the worst case.

The key insight behind Grover's Algorithm is the use of quantum amplitude amplification, which enhances the probability amplitude of the marked item in the quantum superposition of all possible search states. By iteratively applying Grover's search operator, the algorithm converges to the desired solution with high probability in a logarithmic number of iterations.

Grover's Algorithm has been shown to be optimal for unstructured search problems \cite{bennett1997strengths}, and it has been adapted to solve various combinatorial optimization problems \cite{brassard2002quantum, durr1996quantum}. However, the applicability of Grover's Algorithm to specific problems depends on the efficient encoding of the problem's combinatorial structure into an oracle function that can be queried by the algorithm.

\section{Encoding the Weighted Set Packing Problem}\label{sec:encoding}

In order to apply Grover's Algorithm to the WSP, we first need to encode the problem's combinatorial structure into an oracle function that can be queried by the algorithm. The oracle function takes as input a quantum state representing a candidate solution to the WSP and returns a binary value indicating whether the candidate solution satisfies the problem's constraints (i.e., whether the sets in the candidate solution are pairwise disjoint).

To achieve this encoding, we represent each candidate solution to the WSP as a binary string of length $n$, where the $i$-th bit corresponds to the presence (1) or absence (0) of the $i$-th set in the candidate solution. This representation allows us to efficiently evaluate the pairwise disjointness of the sets in a candidate solution by performing bitwise operations on the binary strings.

Given a candidate solution encoded as a binary string, we can construct an oracle function for the WSP as follows: For each pair of sets $(S_i, S_j)$ in the candidate solution, we compute the bitwise AND of their corresponding binary strings. If the result is nonzero for any pair, the candidate solution violates the pairwise disjointness constraint, and the oracle function returns 0. Otherwise, the oracle function returns 1, indicating that the candidate solution is valid.

By encoding the WSP's combinatorial structure into an oracle function in this manner, we enable Grover's Algorithm to efficiently search the space of candidate solutions and identify the optimal solution with high probability.

\section{Quantum Algorithm for Weighted Set Packing}\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we present our quantum algorithm for solving the WSP based on Grover's Algorithm. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Initialize a quantum register of $n$ qubits in the uniform superposition of all possible binary strings representing candidate solutions to the WSP.

2. Apply Grover's search operator iteratively to the quantum register, using the oracle function for the WSP described in Section \ref{sec:encoding}. The number of iterations is chosen to maximize the probability of converging to the optimal solution, which is approximately $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N = 2^n$ is the size of the search space.

3. Measure the quantum register to obtain a binary string representing a candidate solution to the WSP. If the candidate solution is valid (i.e., the sets in the solution are pairwise disjoint), return the solution and its weight (i.e., the sum of the weights of the sets in the solution). Otherwise, repeat steps 2 and 3 until a valid solution is found.

We now analyze the computational complexity of our quantum algorithm. The main source of complexity in the algorithm is the iterative application of Grover's search operator, which requires $O(\sqrt{N})$ iterations to converge to the optimal solution with high probability. Since the size of the search space is exponential in the number of sets ($N = 2^n$), the time complexity of our algorithm is $O(\sqrt{2^n}) = O(2^{n/2})$. This represents a significant speedup over classical algorithms for solving the WSP, which typically have complexity of $O(2^n)$ or greater.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

Our quantum algorithm for solving the WSP using Grover's Algorithm demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize the solution of combinatorial optimization problems. By leveraging the quantum speedup provided by Grover's Algorithm

\section{Weighted Set Packing Problem Representation}

In the context of the ARM assembly code provided, we represent the Weighted Set Packing problem using two registers, R0 and R1. Each register contains the sum of the weights of the elements in a given set. Specifically, R0 stores the sum of the weights of the first set, while R1 stores the sum of the weights of the second set. The values stored in these registers represent a potential solution to the problem.

\section{Problem Constraints}

Given the limitations of the ARM assembly code instructions and the restriction to values up to 3, we simplify the problem to focus on the sum of the weights in both sets. A valid solution to the Weighted Set Packing problem occurs if and only if the sum of the weights in both sets is equal to 3. We will use the ARM assembly code to determine whether the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution under these constraints.

\section{ARM Assembly Code Algorithm}

The ARM assembly code is designed to adhere to the specified constraints while efficiently determining if the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Weighted Set Packing problem. The code consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add the values in R0 and R1, and store the result in R2.
    \item Compare the sum in R2 to the immediate value 3.
    \item Set the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag based on the comparison result.
\end{enumerate}

In the first step, we use the ADD instruction to add the values in R0 and R1 and store the result in R2. This operation computes the sum of the weights in both sets, which will be used in the subsequent comparison.

Next, we employ the CMP instruction to compare the sum in R2 to the immediate value 3. The CMP instruction is a non-destructive operation that compares two values and sets the appropriate condition code flags in the Current Program Status Register (CPSR) based on the result. In our case, we are interested in whether the sum equals 3, which corresponds to the ZERO flag.

Finally, we set the ZERO PSR flag based on the comparison result. If the sum of the weights in R2 equals the immediate value 3, the ZERO flag will be set to 1, indicating that the values in R0 and R1 form a valid solution to the Weighted Set Packing problem. If the sum does not equal 3, the ZERO flag will be set to 0, denoting an invalid solution.

\section{Algorithm Efficiency}

The ARM assembly code algorithm provided is efficient in its execution, as it involves only two instructions (ADD and CMP) to determine the validity of the solution. Furthermore, the code adheres to the imposed constraints, such as avoiding the use of restricted instructions, branches, loops, and labels. Additionally, the algorithm satisfies the requirement that each register must only be used once and cannot be used twice within a single instruction.

\section{Applicability to the Weighted Set Packing Problem}

While the provided ARM assembly code is efficient and adheres to the given constraints, it should be noted that the simplified problem representation and range of values (up to 3) limit its applicability to more general instances of the Weighted Set Packing problem. Nevertheless, the code effectively demonstrates how to implement an efficient algorithm using ARM assembly language to determine the validity of a potential solution under the specified conditions.
