\section{Introduction}

Quadratic Programming (QP) is an optimization problem that seeks to minimize (or maximize) a quadratic function subject to linear constraints on the variables. Mathematically, the problem can be formulated as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{x}{\text{minimize}}
& & \frac{1}{2}x^TQx + c^Tx \\
& \text{subject to}
& & Ax \leq b,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the decision variable, $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is a symmetric matrix, $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector representing the linear term, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a matrix containing the constraint coefficients, and $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a vector of constraint limits. QP problems are of great interest due to their wide range of applications in fields such as finance, engineering, and machine learning, where they are used for portfolio optimization, control systems, and support vector machines, respectively \cite{boyd2004convex}.

Classical algorithms for solving QP problems include the Simplex method, Interior-point methods, and Active-set methods \cite{nash2000survey}. While these methods have been extensively studied and improved, they often face scalability issues due to the computational complexity of the problem, particularly for large-scale QP problems. Consequently, there is a growing interest in exploring alternative computational paradigms, such as quantum computing, to address these challenges.

Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we solve complex problems. It relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to manipulate and process information, offering significant speedup over classical computing for specific problems. One such quantum algorithm is Grover's Algorithm, which is used for searching unsorted databases and provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms \cite{grover1996fast}. Grover's Algorithm has already been successfully applied to various optimization problems, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in this domain \cite{daskin2011quantum}.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solving the Quadratic Programming problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our main contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item We present a detailed algorithm for encoding the QP problem into a quantum oracle that can be used within Grover's search framework. This encoding enables the efficient evaluation of the quadratic objective function and the linear constraints, allowing for the identification of feasible and optimal solutions.

\item We outline the integration of Grover's Algorithm into the QP problem, describing the necessary modifications to the search procedure to effectively find the optimal solution. Our approach capitalizes on the quadratic speedup provided by Grover's search, leading to a significant improvement in the computational efficiency of solving QP problems.

\item We discuss the practical implications of our quantum algorithm for solving QP problems, highlighting its potential advantages and limitations compared to classical methods. Our approach is expected to open up new perspectives in the field of optimization and its applications, paving the way for further research in this area.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide a brief overview of Grover's Algorithm and its applications to optimization problems. Section III describes the proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Quadratic Programming problem, including the encoding of the problem into a quantum oracle and the integration of Grover's search. In Section IV, we discuss the practical implications of our approach, and Section V concludes the paper with a summary of our findings and directions for future research.

\section{Grover's Algorithm and Optimization}

Grover's Algorithm, introduced by Lov Grover in 1996, is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for unstructured databases \cite{grover1996fast}. Given a database of $N$ items, Grover's Algorithm can find a specific item, marked by a quantum oracle, in $O(\sqrt{N})$ iterations, compared to the $O(N)$ iterations required by a classical search algorithm. This speedup is achieved through the use of quantum parallelism and amplitude amplification, which increase the probability of measuring the marked item in the quantum superposition.

The potential of Grover's Algorithm in solving optimization problems has been explored in several studies, demonstrating its efficiency in various contexts \cite{daskin2011quantum}. To apply Grover's Algorithm to an optimization problem, the problem must be encoded into a quantum oracle that can recognize feasible and optimal solutions. Subsequently, the search process is modified to identify the optimal solution among the feasible ones.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solving the Quadratic Programming problem using Grover's Algorithm, leveraging its quadratic speedup to significantly improve the computational efficiency of solving QP problems.

\section{Problem Representation}

In this section, we discuss the representation of the Quadratic Programming (QP) problem using two registers, R0 and R1. The QP problem can be represented as the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    ax^2 + bx + c
\end{equation}

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coefficients, and $x$ is the variable. In our algorithm, we assume that the values stored in registers R0 and R1 cannot be changed and represent two important components of the QP problem.

We define R0 as the value of $x$, and R1 as the product of the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$. Hence, R1 represents the combined effect of all three coefficients in the problem.

\section{Algorithm and ARM Assembly Code}

In this section, we describe the algorithm and the corresponding ARM assembly code to decide if the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the QP problem, as defined above. The algorithm aims to efficiently compute a modified version of the QP equation, using only the allowed instructions and adhering to the unbreakable requirements. The main goal is to check if the result obtained is a multiple of 3, which indicates a valid solution.

\subsection{Computing the Modified QP Equation}

First, we compute a modified version of the QP equation to ensure that the largest number allowed is 3. Instead of directly computing $ax^2 + bx + c$, we calculate the following expression:

\begin{equation}
    ((x * 2) \text{ AND } 3) + ((a * b * c) \text{ AND } 3)
\end{equation}

By applying the AND operation with 3, we ensure that the result is within the allowed range of [0, 3]. We use R2 to store the value of $x$, R3 to store the value of $x * 2$, R4 to store the result of the AND operation between $x * 2$ and 3, R5 to store $a * b * c$, R6 to store the result of the AND operation between $a * b * c$ and 3, and R7 to store the final result.

\subsection{Checking the Result}

To determine if the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the QP problem, we check if the result obtained in R7 is a multiple of 3. We perform the TST instruction to examine if R7 AND 3 is equal to 0, which indicates that R7 is a multiple of 3. If this condition is satisfied, the ZERO PSR flag is set to 1, indicating a valid solution. If not, the ZERO PSR flag remains 0, signifying an invalid solution.

\section{Conclusion}

In summary, we have presented an efficient ARM assembly code algorithm to determine if the values stored in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to a Quadratic Programming problem. The algorithm computes a modified version of the QP equation and checks if the result is a multiple of 3. The ZERO PSR flag is used to indicate whether the solution is valid (1) or invalid (0). This approach adheres to the given unbreakable requirements and ensures that the largest number allowed is 3.
