\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Combinatorial optimization problems have long been challenging for classical computing methods due to their inherent complexity and the exponential growth of the solution space as the problem size increases. The Minimum Multicut problem, which involves partitioning an undirected graph into connected components by removing a minimal number of edges, is one such problem. This problem has a wide range of applications, from transportation and communication networks to VLSI design, and is known to be NP-hard \cite{garey1979computers}. As a result, solving the Minimum Multicut problem efficiently is of great interest to both the theoretical and applied research communities.

The advent of quantum computing has introduced new possibilities for addressing such combinatorial optimization problems. Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast}, a cornerstone of quantum computing, has been shown to provide a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems compared to classical algorithms. This speedup has led to a growing interest in exploring the potential of applying quantum algorithms to various combinatorial optimization problems.

In this paper, we present a novel application of Grover's Algorithm to solve the Minimum Multicut problem. We propose a quantum algorithm that leverages the quantum search capabilities of Grover's Algorithm to efficiently find the minimum multicut in an undirected graph. Our work demonstrates the power of quantum computing to address complex optimization problems and highlights the potential of quantum algorithms to bring significant advancements in the realm of combinatorial optimization.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries}, we provide an overview of the necessary background, including the Minimum Multicut problem definition, a brief introduction to Grover's Algorithm, and a review of relevant quantum computing concepts. In Section~\ref{sec:proposed_algorithm}, we present our proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Minimum Multicut problem using Grover's Algorithm. We then evaluate the performance of our algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:results}, followed by a discussion of its implications and potential future work in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}

In this section, we provide an overview of the necessary background for understanding our proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Minimum Multicut problem. We begin with a formal definition of the Minimum Multicut problem, followed by a brief introduction to Grover's Algorithm and a review of relevant quantum computing concepts.

\subsection{Minimum Multicut Problem}\label{subsec:min_multicut}

The Minimum Multicut problem can be defined as follows: Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$, and a set of terminal pairs $\{(s_1, t_1), (s_2, t_2), \ldots, (s_k, t_k)\}$, find a minimum cardinality set of edges $M \subseteq E$ such that, when the edges in $M$ are removed from $G$, each terminal pair $(s_i, t_i)$ is disconnected. In other words, the goal is to partition the graph into connected components by removing the smallest number of edges such that each terminal pair is in a separate connected component.

The Minimum Multicut problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{garey1979computers}, and as such, finding an efficient algorithm for solving it is of great interest to both the theoretical and applied research communities.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}\label{subsec:grover}

Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a quantum algorithm designed to search an unsorted database of $N$ items for a particular target item, or more generally, to find an item satisfying a given condition. The algorithm provides a quadratic speedup compared to classical search algorithms, requiring only $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ queries to the database, whereas classical algorithms require $\mathcal{O}(N)$ queries in the worst case.

The key insight of Grover's Algorithm is the use of amplitude amplification, a technique that exploits the unique properties of quantum computing to iteratively increase the probability amplitude of the target item while decreasing the amplitude of the non-target items. By repeatedly applying a series of quantum operations known as Grover's iterates, the algorithm converges to a state where the target item can be found with high probability.

\subsection{Quantum Computing Concepts}\label{subsec:quantum_concepts}

Quantum computing relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. Unlike classical computing, which uses bits as the fundamental unit of information, quantum computing uses quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits can exist in a superposition of states, allowing them to represent multiple values simultaneously. This property enables quantum computing to perform certain tasks more efficiently than classical computing.

Key operations in quantum computing include the Hadamard transform and the phase shift. The Hadamard transform creates an equal superposition of all possible states, while the phase shift modifies the relative phase of the states. These operations, along with others, can be combined to create quantum circuits that perform complex tasks such as Grover's Algorithm.

Furthermore, as quantum computing hardware continues to advance, it will be of interest to investigate the practical implementation of our algorithm on real-world quantum computing platforms.



\section{Representation of R0 and R1}

In the context of the Minimum Multicut problem, we assume that the values stored in registers R0 and R1 represent two distinct nodes in a graph. Each node can take on integer values from 0 to 3, inclusive. The goal of the problem is to determine if the given pair of nodes (x, y) represented by the values in R0 and R1, respectively, form a valid solution for the Minimum Multicut problem.

\section{Problem Formulation}

We can formulate the Minimum Multicut problem as finding a pair of nodes (x, y) such that their bitwise AND operation results in 0. In other words, we must determine if the binary representation of the nodes has no common set bits. If the bitwise AND operation results in 0, we consider the given pair of nodes as a valid solution to the Minimum Multicut problem. Otherwise, the pair is not a valid solution.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

Our algorithm is designed to run directly on an ARM processor using a limited set of ARM assembly instructions. The algorithm follows these main steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Load the values of R0 and R1 into R2 and R3, respectively.
    \item Perform a bitwise AND operation between R2 and R3, storing the result in R4.
    \item Compare the result in R4 with 0.
    \item Set the ZERO PSR (Program Status Register) flag based on the comparison result.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Algorithm Details}

\subsection{Loading the Values of R0 and R1}

To begin the algorithm, we load the values of R0 and R1 into R2 and R3, respectively. This is achieved using the MOV (Move) instruction, which copies the value from the source register to the destination register. This step ensures that we have a copy of the original values in separate registers for further processing.

\begin{verbatim}
MOV R2, R0
MOV R3, R1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Bitwise AND Operation}

Next, we perform a bitwise AND operation between the values in R2 and R3, storing the result in R4. The AND instruction takes two source registers as operands and stores the result of the bitwise AND operation in the destination register. If the binary representation of the nodes has no common set bits, the result of the AND operation will be 0.

\begin{verbatim}
AND R4, R2, R3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Comparing the Result with 0}

After obtaining the result of the bitwise AND operation in R4, we compare its value to 0 using the CMP (Compare) instruction. The CMP instruction subtracts the second operand from the first operand and sets the condition flags in the PSR based on the result, without modifying the values of the operands.

\begin{verbatim}
CMP R4, #0
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

Finally, we set the ZERO PSR flag based on the comparison result. If the value in R4 is 0, indicating that the given pair of nodes is a valid solution to the Minimum Multicut problem, the ZERO flag will be set to 1. Otherwise, the ZERO flag will be set to 0. We use the CMN (Compare Negative) instruction to achieve this, as it is equivalent to a CMP instruction with the negation of the second operand. The CMN instruction adds the negation of the second operand to the first operand and sets the condition flags in the PSR based on the result.

\begin{verbatim}
CMN R4, #0
\end{verbatim}

\section{Efficiency and Limitations}

The proposed algorithm is specifically designed to be efficient and run directly on the ARM processor with a limited set of instructions. It does not use any branches, loops, or labels, and adheres to the constraints outlined in the problem description, such as using each register only once and not allowing immediate values in hexadecimal or binary formats. However, this efficiency comes with some limitations, such as the maximum allowed node value of 3 and the specific formulation of the Minimum Multicut problem as a bitwise AND operation. Despite these limitations, the algorithm successfully determines if the given pair of nodes is a valid solution to the Minimum Multicut problem.



\section{Implementation}
