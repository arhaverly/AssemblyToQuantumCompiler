\section{Introduction}

Graph theory is a well-established branch of combinatorial mathematics that has been extensively studied in various domains, including computer science, physics, and social sciences. One of the fundamental problems in graph theory is the Degree Sequence problem, which asks whether a given sequence of non-negative integers can be realized as the degree sequence of a simple graph. The Degree Sequence problem has numerous practical applications, such as understanding the structure of complex networks, modeling social networks, and analyzing biological networks.

Classical algorithms for solving the Degree Sequence problem are well-known, with some of the most notable ones being the Havel-Hakimi algorithm \cite{havel_hakimi} and the Erdős-Gallai theorem \cite{erdos_gallai}. These algorithms work efficiently in polynomial time, making the Degree Sequence problem a solvable problem for classical computers. However, with the rapid development of quantum computing, there is an increasing need to explore efficient quantum algorithms for solving combinatorial problems, including the Degree Sequence problem.

In the realm of quantum computing, Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover} stands out as a prominent quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. Grover's algorithm has been successfully applied to solve various combinatorial problems, such as the traveling salesman problem \cite{tsp_grover}, graph coloring problem \cite{graph_color_grover}, and the satisfiability problem \cite{sat_grover}. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on using Grover's Algorithm to solve the Degree Sequence problem.

In this paper, we propose a novel quantum algorithm based on Grover's Algorithm to solve the Degree Sequence problem. Our algorithm leverages the unique features of quantum computing, such as superposition and entanglement, to efficiently search the solution space of possible graphs. By adapting Grover's search algorithm to the specific characteristics of the Degree Sequence problem, we are able to provide a significant speedup over classical algorithms. 

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving the Degree Sequence problem based on Grover's Algorithm. Our algorithm is the first to apply Grover's Algorithm to the Degree Sequence problem and demonstrates the potential of quantum computing for solving combinatorial graph problems.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide the necessary background on the Degree Sequence problem, classical algorithms for solving it, and Grover's Algorithm that forms the basis of our proposed quantum algorithm.

\subsection{Degree Sequence Problem}

A simple graph $G = (V, E)$ is an undirected graph without loops and multiple edges, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. The degree of a vertex $v \in V$, denoted by $d(v)$, is the number of edges incident to $v$. A degree sequence is a non-increasing sequence of non-negative integers $(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$, where $d_i$ represents the degree of vertex $i$. The Degree Sequence problem asks whether a given sequence $(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$ can be realized as the degree sequence of a simple graph.

\subsection{Classical Algorithms}

There are several classical algorithms for solving the Degree Sequence problem, most notably the Havel-Hakimi algorithm and the Erdős-Gallai theorem. The Havel-Hakimi algorithm is a greedy algorithm that repeatedly removes the highest-degree vertex and reduces the degrees of its neighbors until either all vertices have degree zero or a contradiction is found \cite{havel_hakimi}. The Erdős-Gallai theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence to be graphical, based on the sum of the degrees and the degree sequence's partition into even and odd degrees \cite{erdos_gallai}. Both of these algorithms have polynomial time complexity, making them efficient for solving the Degree Sequence problem on classical computers.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms for unstructured search problems \cite{grover}. Given a black-box function $f$ that marks a unique solution in an unsorted database of size $N$, Grover's Algorithm can find the solution with a complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries to the function $f$. The algorithm works by initializing a quantum register in an equal superposition of all possible states and iteratively applying the Grover's operator, which consists of an oracle that marks the solution state and a diffusion operator that amplifies the probability amplitude of the solution state. After approximately $\sqrt{N}$ iterations, the quantum register collapses to the solution state with high probability upon measurement.

\section{Degree Sequence Problem}
In the context of graph theory, the Degree Sequence problem aims to determine whether a given sequence of non-negative integers can represent the degrees of vertices in a simple, undirected graph. A simple graph is one without loops or multiple edges between vertices, and the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. The Degree Sequence problem seeks to find a valid graph that conforms to the given degree sequence, if one exists.

In our specific implementation, we are given two values, stored in registers R0 and R1, representing the degrees of two vertices in a graph. The range of allowed values for these degrees is limited to the maximum value of 3. Our task is to write an ARM assembly code algorithm that determines whether these values represent a valid solution to the Degree Sequence problem.

\section{Algorithm Description}
Our algorithm focuses on the simple cases of the Degree Sequence problem, where the maximum value for the degrees is 3, and we only have two vertices. The valid degree sequences for this problem are pairs of equal values: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3). The algorithm needs to determine if the given values in R0 and R1 form one of these valid pairs.

\subsection{Computing the Differences}
First, we calculate the differences between the values stored in R0 and R1. The difference R0 - R1 is stored in register R2, and the difference R1 - R0 is stored in register R3. Both of these differences are calculated using the SUB instruction, which subtracts the second operand from the first and stores the result in the destination register.

\begin{verbatim}
SUB R2, R0, R1
SUB R3, R1, R0
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Bitwise OR and NOT Operations}
Next, we perform a bitwise OR operation on the values stored in R2 and R3, and store the result in register R4. The ORR instruction is used for this operation, which takes two source registers and stores the bitwise OR of their values in the destination register.

\begin{verbatim}
ORR R4, R2, R3
\end{verbatim}

Following this, we apply a bitwise NOT operation on the value stored in R4 and store the result in register R5. The MVN instruction is used for this operation, which takes a source register, computes the bitwise NOT of its value, and stores the result in the destination register.

\begin{verbatim}
MVN R5, R4
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Bitwise AND and Comparison}
After that, we perform a bitwise AND operation on the value stored in R5 and the immediate value 3 (since the maximum allowed value is 3), storing the result in register R6. The AND instruction is used for this operation, which takes a source register and an immediate value, computes the bitwise AND of their values, and stores the result in the destination register.

\begin{verbatim}
AND R6, R5, #3
\end{verbatim}

Finally, we compare the value stored in R6 to 0 using the CMP instruction, which sets the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag based on the result. If R6 is zero, then the values in R0 and R1 form a valid solution to the Degree Sequence problem, and the ZERO flag is set to 1. Otherwise, the values are not a solution, and the ZERO flag is set to 0.

\begin{verbatim}
CMP R6, #0
\end{verbatim}

\section{Algorithm Efficiency}
The algorithm presented is efficient for the specific case of the Degree Sequence problem with two vertices and a maximum degree value of 3. It does not use loops, branches, or labels, and it adheres to the given restrictions on register usage and instruction set. The algorithm can be executed directly on the ARM processor with a limited set of available instructions and resources.
