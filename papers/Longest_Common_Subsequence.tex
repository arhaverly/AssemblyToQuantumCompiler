\section{Introduction}

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a well-known problem in computer science and computational biology. Given two sequences $A$ and $B$, the LCS problem is to find the longest sequence which is a subsequence of both $A$ and $B$. This problem has numerous applications, such as determining the similarity between two DNA sequences in bioinformatics \cite{bioinformatics}, detecting differences between files in version control systems \cite{version_control}, and in data compression algorithms \cite{data_compression}.

Classical algorithms for solving the LCS problem have time complexities in the order of $O(nm)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of the input sequences. The most well-known classical algorithm for solving the LCS problem is the dynamic programming approach, which was first proposed by Wagner and Fisher \cite{wagner_fisher}. This algorithm has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement, but its performance degrades rapidly as the lengths of the input sequences increase.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the development of quantum algorithms to solve combinatorial problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. One of the most well-known quantum algorithms is Grover's quantum search algorithm, which can be used to find a marked item in an unsorted database of $N$ items with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$ \cite{grover}. This represents a quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm for the same problem, which has a time complexity of $O(N)$.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the LCS problem using Grover's quantum search algorithm. Our approach involves encoding the LCS problem as an unsorted database search problem, for which Grover's algorithm is ideally suited. We provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance, and show that it has a time complexity in the order of $O(\sqrt{nm})$. This represents a significant improvement over classical solutions, and has the potential to enable new applications in areas where the LCS problem is a computational bottleneck.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we provide a brief introduction to Grover's algorithm and the LCS problem. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we describe our proposed approach for solving the LCS problem using Grover's algorithm, and provide a detailed analysis of its time complexity. In Section \ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss the implications of our results, and suggest directions for future work. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper and summarize our main contributions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide a brief introduction to Grover's algorithm and the LCS problem, which form the basis for our proposed approach.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's algorithm \cite{grover} is a quantum search algorithm that can be used to find a marked item in an unsorted database of $N$ items with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$. This represents a quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm for the same problem, which has a time complexity of $O(N)$. The key idea behind Grover's algorithm is to use quantum parallelism to search the database simultaneously, and to amplify the probability amplitude of the marked item using a series of quantum operations known as Grover iterations.

A high-level description of Grover's algorithm is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize a quantum register of $n$ qubits, where $2^n = N$, in the equal superposition state.
    \item Apply the Grover iteration $O(\sqrt{N})$ times.
    \item Measure the quantum register to obtain the index of the marked item.
\end{enumerate}

Each Grover iteration consists of two main steps: the oracle operation, which marks the desired item by applying a phase shift to its corresponding quantum state, and the diffusion operation, which amplifies the probability amplitude of the marked item by inverting the states around the average amplitude.

\subsection{Longest Common Subsequence Problem}

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic combinatorial problem with a wide range of applications. Given two sequences $A$ and $B$, the LCS problem is to find the longest sequence which is a subsequence of both $A$ and $B$. Formally, a subsequence of a sequence $S$ is a sequence that can be derived from $S$ by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

The most well-known classical algorithm for solving the LCS problem is the dynamic programming approach proposed by Wagner and Fisher \cite{wagner_fisher}. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(nm)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of the input sequences.

\section{Problem Representation}

In this work, we aim to solve the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem, which is a classic computer science problem. Given two sequences $X$ and $Y$, the LCS problem is to find the longest subsequence common to both sequences. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same order in both sequences but not necessarily consecutively. The problem has various applications, including in bioinformatics for sequence alignment, file comparison, and natural language processing.

We represent the lengths of the two subsequences to be compared as values in registers R0 and R1. In our specific example, we want to check if there exists a common subsequence of length 3 within these subsequences. Since each register can only store a single integer value, we model the problem by representing the lengths of the subsequences as integer values.

\section{Algorithm Description}

Our ARM assembly code algorithm operates without loops and branches and adheres to the constraints given. The algorithm is designed to be efficient and compact in its representation. We first explain the algorithm's steps and then present the corresponding ARM assembly code.

\subsection{Algorithm Steps}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the difference between the lengths of the subsequences and the required LCS length (3 in our case) and store the results in two new registers (R2 and R3).
    \item Perform a bitwise AND operation on the most significant bits (MSBs) of the computed differences (R2 and R3). If both MSBs are 0, the result will also be 0, indicating a valid solution.
    \item Update the ZERO PSR flag based on the result obtained in the previous step. If the ZERO flag is set to 1, it means that the values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution to the LCS problem, and if it is 0, they are not a solution.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{ARM Assembly Code}

\begin{verbatim}
START_ASSEMBLY

; Check if R0 and R1 are greater than or equal to 3
; (the required longest common subsequence length)
SUB R2, R0, #3 ; R2 = R0 - 3
SUB R3, R1, #3 ; R3 = R1 - 3

; Compute the bitwise AND of the most significant bits (MSBs)
; of R2 and R3
; If both MSBs are 0, the result will be 0, indicating a valid solution
AND R4, R2, R3, LSR #31 ; R4 = (R2 >> 31) & (R3 >> 31)

; Set the ZERO PSR flag based on the result in R4
CMP R4, #0 ; Compare R4 with 0 and update the flags

END_ASSEMBLY
\end{verbatim}

\section{Algorithm Analysis}

The presented algorithm is designed to be efficient and adhere to the constraints specified in the problem. The algorithm uses basic arithmetic and bitwise operations to perform the LCS check without using loops, branches, or labels. The algorithm's complexity is constant time, as it does not depend on the input size.

One of the key insights of the algorithm is to use the most significant bit (MSB) of the difference between the lengths of the subsequences and the required LCS length. By using the MSB, we can determine if the lengths of the subsequences are greater than or equal to the required LCS length. This operation effectively checks whether the subsequences have the potential to form a common subsequence of at least the given length.

The algorithm's compactness is particularly suitable for limited computer systems where efficiency and code size are critical. While the algorithm is designed for a specific example with an LCS length of 3, it can easily be adapted for other lengths and more complex scenarios by adjusting the immediate values and modifying the arithmetic operations accordingly.
