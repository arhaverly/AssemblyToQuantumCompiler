\section{Introduction}

The Capacitated k-Center problem (CkC) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that has attracted significant attention in the literature due to its numerous real-world applications in facility location, transportation planning, and supply chain management. Given a set of clients and potential facility locations, the objective of the CkC problem is to determine the placement of k facilities such that the maximum distance between a client and its assigned facility is minimized, subject to capacity constraints on the number of clients that each facility can serve. This problem is known to be NP-hard, which has motivated the development of various approximation algorithms and heuristics for its solution.

Quantum computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for tackling complex optimization problems that are intractable using classical computing methods. One of the most well-known quantum algorithms is Grover's Algorithm, which allows for the efficient unstructured search of a database with quadratic speedup over classical search methods. Grover's Algorithm has been successfully applied to solve various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Maximum Clique Problem, by mapping the problem instances onto the search space of Grover's Algorithm.

In this paper, we present a novel quantum algorithm based on Grover's Algorithm to address the Capacitated k-Center problem. We first provide a detailed description of the CkC problem and its classical solution methods, followed by an introduction to Grover's Algorithm and its application to combinatorial optimization problems. Next, we propose a quantum algorithm for the CkC problem, which involves encoding the problem instance as a binary string and defining a suitable oracle function for the search process. We then perform a thorough analysis of the proposed algorithm's performance, including its complexity, speedup, and approximation ratio, and compare it with existing classical techniques.

The primary contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We propose a quantum algorithm based on Grover's Algorithm to tackle the Capacitated k-Center problem, which has not been previously explored in the literature. This represents a significant step towards harnessing the power of quantum computing for solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems.
    
    \item We present a detailed analysis of the proposed quantum algorithm's performance, including its complexity, speedup, and approximation ratio. Our findings indicate that the quantum algorithm can outperform classical approaches under specific conditions, which has important implications for the design and implementation of quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization.
    
    \item We provide a thorough comparison of our proposed quantum algorithm with existing classical techniques for the Capacitated k-Center problem. This comparison serves to highlight the potential benefits and limitations of our approach, as well as to identify future research directions in the field of quantum computing for combinatorial optimization.

\section{Capacitated k-Center Problem Representation}

In the Capacitated k-Center problem, we are given a set of clients with associated demands and a set of potential facility locations. Each facility has a maximum capacity, and the objective is to open a limited number of facilities (k) such that the total demand of the clients assigned to each facility does not exceed its capacity, and the maximum distance between a client and its assigned facility is minimized. In our implementation, we use the ARM assembly code to represent a solution to the Capacitated k-Center problem using the registers R0 and R1, where the values in R0 and R1 represent the capacity and the number of centers (k), respectively.

\section{Algorithm Description}

Our algorithm aims to determine if the values stored in R0 and R1 provide a valid solution to the Capacitated k-Center problem. To be a valid solution, the capacity (R0) must be greater than 0, and the number of centers (R1) must also be greater than 0. In order to verify these conditions, we use ARM assembly instructions provided and adhere to the constraints mentioned.

\subsection{Checking Capacity (R0)}

First, we check if the capacity stored in R0 is greater than 0. This is achieved using the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare the value in R0 with 1 using the CMP instruction.
    \item Initialize R2 to 0 using the MOV instruction.
    \item Negate and compare R0 with 1 using the CMN instruction.
    \item If R0 is greater than 0, negate R2 using the MVN instruction.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Checking Number of Centers (R1)}

Next, we check if the number of centers stored in R1 is greater than 0. This is achieved using the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare the value in R1 with 1 using the CMP instruction.
    \item Initialize R3 to 0 using the MOV instruction.
    \item Negate and compare R1 with 1 using the CMN instruction.
    \item If R1 is greater than 0, negate R3 using the MVN instruction.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Combining Results and Setting ZERO Flag}

After checking the values of R0 and R1, we combine the results to determine if both conditions hold true:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform a bitwise AND operation on R2 and R3 using the AND instruction, storing the result in R4.
    \item Test the value in R4 with 1 using the TST instruction, which sets the ZERO flag according to the result.
\end{enumerate}

The ZERO flag in the PSR will be set to 1 if the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Capacitated k-Center problem, and 0 otherwise.

\section{Efficiency Considerations}

The algorithm is designed to be efficient given the constraints of the limited computer running the program. The ARM assembly code does not use loops, branches, or labels, and each register is only used once to perform its designated operation. Additionally, the algorithm requires only a small number of instructions to determine the validity of the solution, ensuring a minimal computational overhead.

\section{Conclusion}

The ARM assembly code provided efficiently determines if the values stored in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Capacitated k-Center problem, adhering to the constraints of a limited computer system. By checking the capacity and the number of centers, the algorithm ensures that the solution meets the requirements of the problem, and the ZERO flag in the PSR indicates the validity of the solution.
