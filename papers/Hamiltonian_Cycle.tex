\section{Introduction}

The Hamiltonian Cycle problem is a classical problem in computer science and graph theory. Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, the goal is to determine if there exists a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. This problem is NP-complete, which implies that, unless P = NP, there is no efficient classical algorithm for solving it in the general case. The development of efficient algorithms for solving NP-complete problems has been a long-standing goal in computer science and combinatorial optimization.

Quantum computing has emerged as a promising approach for solving problems that are intractable for classical computers. A quantum computer utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations. Quantum algorithms, like Grover's Algorithm, have been shown to outperform their classical counterparts in several problem domains. Grover's Algorithm, in particular, is used for searching an unsorted database of $N$ items and has a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms with a time complexity of $O(N)$.

In this paper, we present a novel application of Grover's Algorithm to the Hamiltonian Cycle problem. We develop a quantum algorithm that leverages the quadratic speedup provided by Grover's Algorithm to potentially solve the Hamiltonian Cycle problem more efficiently than classical algorithms. The algorithm utilizes an oracle, which is a black-box function that can recognize a correct Hamiltonian cycle. We then use Grover's Algorithm to search for a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph, by iteratively applying the oracle and Grover's diffusion operator.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:preliminaries}, we provide an overview of the necessary background concepts, including a brief introduction to quantum computing, the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, and Grover's Algorithm. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present our quantum algorithm for solving the Hamiltonian Cycle problem using Grover's Algorithm, including a detailed description of the oracle construction and the overall search procedure. In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, we analyze the time complexity of the proposed algorithm and compare it with classical algorithms for solving the Hamiltonian Cycle problem. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper and discuss potential directions for future research.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

\subsection{Quantum Computing}

Quantum computing is a computational paradigm that exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations. Unlike classical bits, which can only represent either a 0 or a 1, quantum bits, or qubits, can exist in superpositions of both 0 and 1 states. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations more efficiently than classical computers.

A quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ of a system of $n$ qubits is described by a complex vector in a $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space. Quantum operations, or gates, are represented by unitary matrices that act on the quantum state. Some common quantum gates include the Hadamard gate, the Pauli-X gate, and the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. The measurement of a quantum state collapses it to a classical bit value, with probabilities determined by the coefficients of the quantum state vector.

\subsection{Hamiltonian Cycle Problem}

The Hamiltonian Cycle problem is defined as follows: Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, determine if there exists a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. This problem is known to be NP-complete, which means that it is unlikely that there exists an efficient classical algorithm for solving it in the general case.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm, proposed by Lov Grover in 1996, is a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time. The algorithm uses a quantum oracle, which is a black-box function that can recognize the correct item in the database. The key component of Grover's Algorithm is the Grover iteration, which consists of the application of the oracle followed by the Grover diffusion operator. This iteration is applied $\sqrt{N}$ times to amplify the probability of the correct item in the quantum state, allowing it to be found with high probability upon measurement.

\section{Quantum Algorithm for Hamiltonian Cycle}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we present our quantum algorithm for solving the Hamiltonian Cycle problem using Grover's Algorithm. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Encode the graph $G = (V, E)$ as a binary string.
  \item Construct a quantum oracle $O_H$ that recognizes a correct Hamiltonian cycle.
  \item Use Grover's Algorithm to search for a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph, iteratively applying the oracle $O_H$ and the Grover diffusion operator.
\end{enumerate}

We will now describe each of these steps in detail.

\textbf{Step 1: Encoding the Graph.} The first step in our algorithm is to encode the graph $G = (V, E)$ as a binary string. Let $n$ be the number of vertices in the graph. We can represent a potential Hamiltonian cycle as a permutation of the vertices, which can be encoded as an $n \log n$-bit binary string. This encoding allows us to search for a Hamiltonian cycle using Grover's Algorithm.

\textbf{Step 2: Constructing the Oracle.} The next step is to construct a quantum oracle $O_H$ that recognizes a correct Hamiltonian cycle. The oracle takes as input a binary string representing a potential Hamiltonian cycle and outputs 1 if the cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle of the graph, and 0 otherwise. The oracle can be implemented using classical circuits that check the adjacency of consecutive vertices in the cycle and the uniqueness of visited vertices.

\textbf{Step 3: Searching for a Hamiltonian Cycle.} Finally, we use Grover's Algorithm to search for a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. We initialize a quantum register of $n \log n$ qubits in an equal superposition of all possible binary strings, representing all potential Hamiltonian cycles. We then iteratively apply the oracle $O_H$ and the Grover diffusion operator to amplify the probability of the correct Hamiltonian cycle in the quantum state. After approximately $\sqrt{N}$ iterations, where $N = n!$, we measure the quantum state to obtain a Hamiltonian cycle with high probability.

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

The time complexity of our quantum algorithm for the Hamiltonian Cycle problem is dominated by two factors: the construction of the oracle, and the number of Grover iterations required to find a Hamiltonian cycle. The oracle can be implemented using classical circuits with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$. The number of Grover iterations required is proportional to $\sqrt{N}$, where $N = n!$. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^2 \sqrt{n!})$.

While this time complexity is not polynomial in $n$, it is significantly better than the best-known classical algorithms for solving the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, which have time complexity of $O(n!)$. This demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to solve hard computational problems more efficiently than classical computing.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a quantum algorithm for solving the Hamiltonian Cycle problem using Grover's Algorithm. We have shown that the algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2 \sqrt{n!})$, which is significantly better than the best-known classical algorithms for solving the problem. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to tackle hard computational problems more efficiently than classical computing.

There are several avenues for future research in this area. One possible direction is to explore the use of other quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Walks or Quantum Annealing, to solve the Hamiltonian Cycle problem. Another direction is to investigate the application of Grover's Algorithm to other hard computational problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem or the Graph Coloring Problem.

\section{Problem Representation}

In the given problem, we are to determine if the values stored in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Hamiltonian Cycle problem. For the sake of simplicity and due to the limitation of the largest number being 3, we consider a graph with a maximum of 3 vertices (0, 1, and 2). Hamiltonian Cycle problem aims to find a cycle that visits each vertex of the graph exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. In other words, if the graph is a complete graph, it has a Hamiltonian cycle. 

The values in R0 and R1 represent the adjacency matrix of the graph. The adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. In our case, the adjacency matrix is of size 3x3, and R0 and R1 store two rows of this matrix. The third row can be inferred from the first two rows as the graph is undirected.

\section{Algorithm Explanation}

The ARM assembly code provided aims to determine if the given graph is a complete graph or not. A complete graph is a simple, undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In the case of 3 vertices, the complete graph is a triangle. As the graph is undirected, the adjacency matrix is symmetric about the main diagonal. Therefore, our goal is to check if both R0 and R1 have bits 1 and 2 set (excluding the diagonal). If all the non-diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix are set, then the graph is a complete graph and has a Hamiltonian cycle.

The algorithm starts by loading the value 6 (binary 110) into R2. This value is used to mask the bits 1 and 2 in R0 and R1. Then, bitwise AND operations are performed between R0 and R2, and between R1 and R2. The results are stored in R3 and R4, respectively. If both R0 and R1 have bits 1 and 2 set, then R3 and R4 will both be equal to R2 (6).

Next, the algorithm checks if R3 and R4 are equal to R2 by subtracting R2 from R3 and R4, and storing the results in R5 and R6, respectively. If R3 and R4 are equal to R2, then R5 and R6 will both be 0. This indicates that the non-diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix are set.

To determine if both R5 and R6 are 0, a bitwise OR operation is performed between them and the result is stored in R7. If R7 is 0, then both R5 and R6 are 0, indicating that the graph is a complete graph and has a Hamiltonian cycle.

Finally, the algorithm sets the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag by comparing R7 with 0 using a CMP instruction. If R7 is 0, the ZERO flag is set to 1, indicating that the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Hamiltonian Cycle problem. On the other hand, if R7 is non-zero, the ZERO flag is set to 0, indicating that the values in R0 and R1 do not represent a valid solution.

\section{Efficiency and Limitations}

The provided algorithm is efficient as it does not use loops, branches, or labels, and adheres to the given set of instructions and unbreakable requirements. It performs only simple arithmetic and bitwise operations to determine if the given graph is a complete graph or not.

However, the algorithm has some limitations. The main limitation is that it can only handle graphs with a maximum of 3 vertices due to the largest number allowed being 3. Additionally, the algorithm assumes that the input graph is undirected and simple, meaning it does not have multiple edges between the same pair of vertices or self-loops. Furthermore, the algorithm relies on the ZERO PSR flag to provide the result, which might not be the most convenient way to output the result in a real-world scenario.
