% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The Feedback Arc Set (FAS) problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, having applications in various domains such as project scheduling, circuit layout optimization, and social network analysis \cite{fas_applications}. The problem can be formally defined as follows: Given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, find the minimum cardinality set of arcs (edges) $F \subseteq E$ such that their removal results in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The FAS problem is NP-hard \cite{fas_np_hard}, which means that finding an efficient and exact solution using classical computing methods is computationally challenging.

Quantum computing, on the other hand, has shown promise in solving complex problems efficiently by exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics \cite{quantum_computing}. Grover's Algorithm, introduced by Lov Grover in 1996 \cite{grover_original}, is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. Given an unsorted database of $N$ items, Grover's Algorithm can find a marked item with a probability of at least $1/2$ using $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries, which is a significant improvement over the classical linear search, which requires $O(N)$ queries in the worst case \cite{grover_bound}. This quadratic speedup has been applied to various problems, including combinatorial optimization \cite{grover_comb_opt}.

In this paper, we propose a novel technique for solving the Feedback Arc Set problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our approach involves encoding the problem into a suitable search space and iteratively applying Grover's Algorithm to find the optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve the FAS problem using Grover's Algorithm. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We present a formal description of the proposed algorithm for solving the Feedback Arc Set problem using Grover's Algorithm, including the necessary quantum circuits and operations.
    
    \item We analyze the time complexity of the proposed algorithm and compare its performance with classical algorithms for solving the Feedback Arc Set problem.
    
    \item We provide a discussion on the potential advantages and limitations of the proposed approach, as well as suggestions for future research in the area of quantum algorithms for complex problem-solving tasks.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:background} provides the necessary background on the Feedback Arc Set problem and Grover's Algorithm. Section \ref{sec:proposed_algorithm} presents the proposed algorithm, including its formal description and analysis. In Section \ref{sec:results}, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with classical algorithms for solving the FAS problem. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and discusses future research directions.

% Background
\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
In this section, we provide a brief overview of the Feedback Arc Set problem and Grover's Algorithm, which are essential to understanding the proposed approach.

\subsection{Feedback Arc Set Problem}
The Feedback Arc Set problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding the smallest set of arcs in a directed graph, which, when removed, results in an acyclic directed graph. Formally, given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of directed edges (arcs), the goal is to find a minimum cardinality set of arcs $F \subseteq E$ such that $G'=(V,E-F)$ is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

The FAS problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{fas_np_hard}, which implies that finding an efficient and exact solution using classical computing methods is computationally challenging. Several heuristic and approximation algorithms have been proposed in the literature to tackle the FAS problem \cite{fas_heuristics,fas_approximations}. However, these algorithms do not guarantee an optimal solution and can often result in suboptimal solutions.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. Given an unsorted database of $N$ items, Grover's Algorithm can find a marked item with a probability of at least $1/2$ using $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries, which is a significant improvement over the classical linear search, which requires $O(N)$ queries in the worst case \cite{grover_bound}.

The key idea behind Grover's Algorithm is the use of amplitude amplification, which is a technique for increasing the amplitude (probability) of the marked item in a quantum state, while decreasing the amplitude of the unmarked items. This is achieved through a series of iterations, each consisting of two main operations: the Grover oracle and the Grover diffusion operator, which are applied to the quantum state in a specific order. After a sufficient number of iterations, the quantum state converges to a state where the marked item has a high probability of being observed upon measurement.

% Proposed Algorithm
\section{Proposed Algorithm}
\label{sec:proposed_algorithm}
In this section, we present the proposed algorithm for solving the Feedback Arc Set problem using Grover's Algorithm. We begin by encoding the problem into a suitable search space and then describe the necessary quantum circuits and operations for implementing the algorithm.

\subsection{Problem Encoding}
The first step in solving the Feedback Arc Set problem using Grover's Algorithm is to encode the problem into a suitable search space. This involves representing the directed graph $G=(V,E)$ and the set of arcs $F \subseteq E$ as binary strings, which can be used as input to the quantum search algorithm. To achieve this, we use a binary matrix $M$ of size $n \times n$, where $n = |V|$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Each element $M_{ij}$ of the matrix corresponds to the arc $(i,j) \in E$, and its binary value indicates whether the arc is included in the FAS ($1$) or not ($0$). The search space for the FAS problem then consists of all possible binary matrices of size $n \times n$.

\section{Feedback Arc Set Problem Representation}

In the Feedback Arc Set problem, we are given a directed graph with a set of nodes and directed edges. The objective is to find a minimal set of edges, such that removing these edges from the graph results in an acyclic graph. In our simplified example, we consider a directed graph with a maximum of three nodes. The values in R0 and R1 represent the number of incoming and outgoing edges for a node, respectively.

\section{Valid Solution Criteria}

For a valid solution to the Feedback Arc Set problem, there should be no cycles in the directed graph. In this simplified example with a maximum of 3 nodes, a valid solution means that the number of incoming edges (R0) should be less than or equal to 1, and the number of outgoing edges (R1) should be less than or equal to 1. This is because, in the worst case, a directed graph with three nodes can have one cycle, and removing one edge can break this cycle, making the graph acyclic.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

The algorithm is implemented using ARM assembly code without loops, branches, or labels. It consists of several steps that include comparisons, arithmetic operations, and logical operations. The primary purpose of the algorithm is to determine if the values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution for the Feedback Arc Set problem and store the result in the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag. Setting the value to 1 indicates that the values in R0 and R1 are a solution, and 0 is not a solution.

\section{Algorithm Steps}

The algorithm follows a series of steps to perform the necessary calculations and comparisons to determine if the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Feedback Arc Set problem. These steps are described below:

\subsection{Subtraction Operations}

The algorithm starts by subtracting 1 from R0 and R1, storing the results in R2 and R3, respectively. These subtraction operations are performed to compare R0 and R1 with the threshold value of 1, which is required for a valid solution.

\begin{equation}
R2 = R0 - 1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R3 = R1 - 1
\end{equation}

\subsection{Checking for Non-Negative Values}

The algorithm then performs a bitwise AND operation on R2 and R3 to check if both values are non-negative. The result of this operation is stored in R4.

\begin{equation}
R4 = R2 \: \mathrm{AND} \: R3
\end{equation}

Non-negative values of R2 and R3 indicate that both R0 and R1 are greater than or equal to 1.

\subsection{Checking for Values Less Than or Equal to 1}

Next, the algorithm performs a bitwise OR operation on R2 and R3 to check if both values are less than or equal to 1. The result of this operation is stored in R5.

\begin{equation}
R5 = R2 \: \mathrm{OR} \: R3
\end{equation}

This operation ensures that both R0 and R1 are less than or equal to 1, which is a necessary condition for a valid solution.

\subsection{Combining the Results}

The algorithm then combines the results obtained in the previous steps by performing a bitwise AND operation on the inverted R4 and R5. The result is stored in R7.

\begin{equation}
R6 = \mathrm{NOT} \: R4
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R7 = R6 \: \mathrm{AND} \: R5
\end{equation}

This step checks if both conditions (non-negative values and values less than or equal to 1) are met simultaneously.

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

Finally, the algorithm sets the ZERO PSR flag based on the value in R7. If R7 is non-zero, then both R0 and R1 are less than or equal to 1, indicating a valid solution.

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{TST} \: R7, 1
\end{equation}

\section{Summary}

The proposed algorithm checks if the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution for the Feedback Arc Set problem using ARM assembly code without loops, branches, or labels. The algorithm follows several steps, including subtraction, bitwise operations, and comparison, to determine if the values in R0 and R1 meet the necessary conditions for a valid solution. The result is stored in the ZERO PSR flag, indicating whether the values in R0 and R1 are a solution to the problem.
