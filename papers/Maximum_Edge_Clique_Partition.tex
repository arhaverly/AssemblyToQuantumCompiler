\section{Introduction}

Combinatorial optimization problems have been extensively studied due to their wide range of applications in computer science, operations research, economics, and many other fields. One such problem is the Maximum Edge Clique Partition (MECP) problem, which deals with partitioning the vertices of a given undirected graph into disjoint cliques such that the total number of edges in the cliques is maximized. The MECP problem has applications in areas such as social network analysis, clustering, and data mining. However, due to its NP-hard nature, finding an exact solution for the MECP problem becomes computationally challenging as the size of the input graph increases.

Quantum computing has emerged as a promising field that can potentially offer efficient solutions to various combinatorial optimization problems, including the MECP problem. Quantum algorithms exploit the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations that are infeasible using classical computers. Among the known quantum algorithms, Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996} stands out as one of the most significant due to its quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. Grover's Algorithm has been successfully applied to solve various search and optimization problems, making it a suitable candidate for tackling the MECP problem.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve the MECP problem using Grover's Algorithm. The main contributions of our work are as follows:

\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm, proposed by Lov K. Grover in 1996 \cite{grover1996}, is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. It can be used to search an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, whereas the best possible classical algorithm requires $O(N)$ steps. The algorithm mainly consists of two main components: the oracle function and the Grover iteration.

The oracle function, denoted as $O$, is a black-box function that, when given an input, determines whether the input is the desired solution or not. The Grover iteration, also known as the Grover operator, is a unitary transformation that amplifies the amplitude of the correct solution in the quantum state. The Grover iteration consists of four steps: application of the oracle function $O$, application of the Hadamard transformation $H^{\otimes n}$, application of the conditional phase shift $D$, and application of the Hadamard transformation $H^{\otimes n}$ again. The Grover iteration is applied repeatedly until the correct solution is found with high probability.

\subsection{Applications of Grover's Algorithm in Combinatorial Optimization}

Grover's Algorithm has been applied to various combinatorial optimization problems, including the traveling salesman problem \cite{tsp_grover}, the knapsack problem \cite{knapsack_grover}, and the graph coloring problem \cite{graph_coloring_grover}. The main idea behind these applications is to formulate the problem as a search problem, where the objective is to find the optimal solution among a set of candidate solutions. The oracle function is designed to recognize the optimal solution, while the Grover iteration is used to amplify the amplitude of the correct solution in the quantum state. The algorithm is then applied iteratively to find the optimal solution with high probability.

In the context of the MECP problem, our goal is to partition the vertices of a given undirected graph into disjoint cliques such that the total number of edges in the cliques is maximized. We can formulate this problem as a search problem by considering all possible partitions of the vertices and searching for the partition that maximizes the total number of edges. By designing an appropriate oracle function and using Grover's Algorithm, we aim to find the optimal solution efficiently.

\section{Proposed Algorithm} \label{sec:proposed_algorithm}

In this section, we present our proposed algorithm for solving the MECP problem using Grover's Algorithm. We first discuss the problem formulation in terms of quantum gates and circuits, and then provide a detailed description of the steps required to perform the search and optimization.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, our objective is to partition the vertices of the graph into disjoint cliques such that the total number of edges in the cliques is maximized. We denote the set of all possible partitions of the vertices as $\mathcal{P}$, and the optimal partition as $P^* \in \mathcal{P}$.

To formulate the MECP problem in terms of quantum gates and circuits, we first represent the graph $G$ using an adjacency matrix $A$. The adjacency matrix is a symmetric matrix of size $|V| \times |V|$, where the element $A_{ij}$ is equal to 1 if there is an edge between vertices $i$ and $j$, and 0 otherwise. We then encode the set of possible partitions $\mathcal{P}$ using a set of $n$ qubits, where $n = \lceil \log_2 |\mathcal{P}| \rceil$. Each qubit is initially in the state $|0\rangle$, and the initial state of the quantum system is given by the equal superposition of all possible partitions:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|\mathcal{P}|}} \sum_{P \in \mathcal{P}} \ket{P}.
\end{equation}

We then design an oracle function $O$ that, when given a partition $P$, determines whether the partition is optimal or not. The oracle function is implemented using a combination of quantum gates and circuits, such as controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, Toffoli gates, and phase shift gates. The specific implementation of the oracle function depends on the structure of the graph and the representation of the partitions.

\subsection{Search and Optimization}

Once the problem is formulated in terms of quantum gates and circuits, we can apply Grover's Algorithm to perform the search and optimization. The main steps of the algorithm are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize the quantum system in the equal superposition state $\ket{\psi_0}$.
    \item Apply the oracle function $O$ to the quantum system.
    \item Apply the Grover iteration to the quantum system. The Grover iteration consists of the following steps:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Apply the Hadamard transformation $H^{\otimes n}$ to the quantum system.
            \item Apply the conditional phase shift $D$ to the quantum system.
            \item Apply the Hadamard transformation $H^{\otimes n}$ to the quantum system again.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Repeat steps

\section{Problem Definition}

The Maximum Edge Clique Partition (MECP) problem is a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a given undirected graph into disjoint cliques such that the sum of the edges in these cliques is maximized. The problem can be stated as follows:

Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, find a partition $P = \{C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_k\}$ of the vertex set $V$, where each $C_i$ is a clique in $G$, and the total number of edges in the cliques is maximal.

In our specific case, we are given two values stored in registers R0 and R1, and we need to determine if these values represent a valid solution to the MECP problem for a graph with a maximum allowed value of 3.

\section{Algorithm Description}

Our algorithm checks if the sum of the values in R0 and R1 is equal to the sum of all numbers from 1 to the largest number allowed, which is 3 in this case. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 3 is $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$. Therefore, a valid solution to the MECP problem would be if $R0 + R1 = 6$. 

We implement this algorithm using ARM assembly code without loops using the following instructions: ADC, ADD, AND, BIC, CMN, CMP, EOR, LSL, LSR, MOV, MRS, MSR, MVN, ORR, RSB, RSC, SBC, STR, SUB, TEQ, and TST.

\section{ARM Assembly Code}

The ARM assembly code for our algorithm is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
START_ASSEMBLY

; R0 and R1 contain the input values
; R2 will be used to store the result of the comparison

; Calculate the sum of R0 and R1
ADD R2, R0, R1

; Compare the sum to 6
CMP R2, #6

; Set the ZERO flag if the sum is equal to 6
; The result is stored in the APSR flags
; APSR.NZCV = R2 - 6
; Z flag will be set to 1 if R2 - 6 = 0 (i.e., R2 = 6)
; Otherwise, Z flag will be set to 0

END_ASSEMBLY
\end{verbatim}

\section{Algorithm Explanation}

The ARM assembly code calculates the sum of R0 and R1 using the ADD instruction and stores the result in register R2. Then, it compares the value in R2 with the immediate value 6 using the CMP instruction. This is equivalent to subtracting 6 from the value in R2 and updating the Application Program Status Register (APSR) flags based on the result of the subtraction. The APSR flags are NZCV, which stand for Negative, Zero, Carry, and Overflow, respectively.

If the result of the subtraction is zero, i.e., the value in R2 is equal to 6, the Zero flag in the APSR is set to 1. Otherwise, the Zero flag is set to 0. This effectively stores the result of our algorithm, indicating whether the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the MECP problem, in the Zero flag of the processor's status register.

It is important to note that our algorithm follows the given constraints: it does not use any forbidden instructions, loops, or branches; each register is used only once; a register is not used twice in an instruction; and the Zero flag is set only once.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

Our algorithm is designed for a specific case of the MECP problem, where the largest number allowed is 3. The algorithm can be easily adapted for larger graphs by changing the immediate value in the CMP instruction to the sum of all numbers from 1 to the new largest number allowed. However, for more complex cases or larger graphs, more efficient algorithms and more advanced ARM assembly instructions may be needed.

In future work, it would be interesting to explore the performance of our algorithm in comparison to other algorithms for the MECP problem, as well as to investigate the possibility of extending the algorithm to handle more general cases of the problem. Additionally, the use of more advanced ARM assembly instructions and techniques, such as SIMD instructions for parallel processing, could potentially improve the performance and efficiency of the algorithm.
