% Introduction

\section{Introduction}

The Node Capacitated Cut (NCC) problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that arises in various fields, such as network design, VLSI design, and transportation \cite{NCC_problem}. In its most general form, the NCC problem is defined on an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges. Each node $v \in V$ has an associated capacity $c(v)$, and the objective is to find a minimum cut $(S, \bar{S})$ of the graph, partitioning the nodes into two disjoint sets $S$ and $\bar{S}$, such that the sum of capacities of nodes in each set does not exceed a predefined threshold. The NCC problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{NCC_NP_hard}, which implies that finding an optimal solution becomes computationally expensive as the problem size increases.

Quantum computing has emerged as a promising technology for solving complex optimization problems more efficiently than classical computing \cite{Quantum_computing}. Among various quantum algorithms, Grover's Algorithm \cite{Grover} has attracted significant attention due to its ability to search an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, offering a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms in various applications \cite{Grover_applications}. In this paper, we present a novel application of Grover's Algorithm to the NCC problem, leveraging the advantages of quantum computing to address the computational complexity associated with the problem.

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We present a quantum algorithm based on Grover's Algorithm to solve the NCC problem. Our approach combines the benefits of quantum computing with the characteristics of the NCC problem, resulting in a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms.

\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

\subsection{Node Capacitated Cut Problem}

The Node Capacitated Cut (NCC) problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that can be formally defined as follows. Let $G=(V, E)$ be an undirected graph, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges. Each node $v \in V$ has an associated capacity $c(v)$. The objective is to find a minimum cut $(S, \bar{S})$ of the graph, partitioning the nodes into two disjoint sets $S$ and $\bar{S}$, such that $\sum_{v \in S} c(v) \leq C$ and $\sum_{v \in \bar{S}} c(v) \leq C$, where $C$ is a predefined capacity threshold. The NCC problem has been extensively studied in the literature, and various exact and heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve it \cite{NCC_algorithms}. However, due to its NP-hard nature, determining an optimal solution remains computationally expensive as the problem size increases.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm that enables searching an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, providing a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms \cite{Grover}. The algorithm is based on the principles of quantum computing, such as superposition, entanglement, and interference, to efficiently search for a target item in the database. The main idea behind Grover's Algorithm is to iteratively apply a quantum operation, called the Grover iterate, to a uniform superposition of all possible solutions, amplifying the probability amplitude of the target solution while reducing the amplitudes of the other solutions. The Grover iterate consists of two main operations: the oracle operation, which marks the target solution, and the diffusion operation, which inverts the amplitudes about their average. After approximately $\sqrt{N}$ iterations of the Grover iterate, the target solution can be obtained with high probability by measuring the quantum state.

Grover's Algorithm has been successfully applied to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem \cite{Grover_TSP}, the satisfiability problem \cite{Grover_SAT}, and the maximum clique problem \cite{Grover_clique}. In this paper, we propose a novel application of Grover's Algorithm to the NCC problem, exploiting the advantages of quantum computing to address the computational challenges associated with the problem.

\section{Quantum Algorithm for the NCC Problem} \label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we present our proposed quantum algorithm for the NCC problem, based on Grover's Algorithm. Our approach combines the benefits of quantum computing with the characteristics of the NCC problem, resulting in a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms. We provide a detailed description of the quantum algorithm, including the necessary quantum circuits and the required number of qubits, as well as the implementation steps.

\subsection{Quantum Representation}

To apply Grover's Algorithm to the NCC problem, we first need to represent the problem in the quantum domain. We encode the graph $G=(V, E)$ and the node capacities $c(v)$ using a set of qubits. Let $n = |V|$ be the number of nodes in the graph. We use $n$ qubits to represent the partition of the nodes into sets $S$ and $\bar{S}$. Specifically, the $i$-th qubit corresponds to the $i$-th node in the graph, and its state determines whether the node belongs to set $S$ ($|0\rangle$) or set $\bar{S}$ ($|1\rangle$). In addition, we use $\lceil \log_2 C \rceil$ qubits to represent the capacities of the sets, allowing us to perform capacity checks during the algorithm.

\subsection{Oracle and Diffusion Operations}

The oracle operation in our quantum algorithm is responsible for marking the target solution, i.e., a valid cut $(S, \bar{S})$ satisfying the capacity constraints. To implement the oracle, we construct a quantum circuit that checks whether the capacities of sets $S$ and $\bar{S}$ are within the predefined threshold $C$. If the capacity constraints are satisfied, the oracle flips the phase of the corresponding quantum state, marking the solution as a potential candidate. The oracle operation can be efficiently implemented using a combination of CNOT gates, Toffoli gates, and an ancillary qubit to store the result of the capacity checks.

The diffusion operation in our algorithm aims to amplify the probability amplitude of the marked solutions while reducing the amplitudes of the other solutions. The diffusion operation can be implemented using a standard Grover diffusion circuit, consisting of Hadamard gates, phase shift gates, and a multi-qubit controlled-Z gate. The diffusion circuit is applied to the $n$ qubits representing the nodes, leaving the capacity qubits unchanged.

\subsection{Implementation Steps}

Our proposed quantum algorithm for the NCC problem can be implemented in the following steps:

1. Prepare a uniform superposition of all possible solutions by applying Hadamard gates to the $n$ qubits representing the nodes.

2. Iteratively apply the Grover iterate, consisting of the oracle operation and the diffusion operation, to the quantum state. The number of iterations should be approximately $\sqrt{N}$, where $N = 2^n$ is the total number of possible cuts.

3. Measure the quantum state to

\section{Node Capacitated Cut Problem Representation}

In the Node Capacitated Cut problem, we are given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges. Each node in the graph has a capacity that it can handle. The goal is to find a partition of the nodes into two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ such that the sum of the capacities of the nodes in the subsets is maximized, while minimizing the total weight of the edges connecting the nodes in the two subsets.

In our ARM assembly code solution, we represent the capacities of two nodes A and B using registers R0 and R1 respectively. We assume that these capacities are given as inputs and cannot be changed. In this specific example, the largest number allowed for capacities is 3.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

To determine whether the capacities of nodes A and B form a valid solution to the Node Capacitated Cut problem, we follow a series of steps using ARM assembly instructions. Our goal is to store the result in the ZERO Processor Status Register (PSR) flag. A value of 1 in the ZERO flag indicates that the capacities of nodes A and B are a valid solution, while a value of 0 indicates that they are not a valid solution.

\section{Algorithm Steps}

\subsection{Loading Immediate Values}

We start by loading the immediate values 3 and 0 into registers R2 and R3. The value 3 is the threshold for determining whether the combined capacity of nodes A and B is a valid solution or not. The value 0 is used for comparison purposes later in the algorithm.

\subsection{Calculating Combined Capacity}

We first subtract the value in R0 from R2, and store the result in R4. This calculates the difference between 3 and the capacity of node A. Next, we add the value in R1 to R4, and store the result in R5. This calculates the combined capacity of nodes A and B minus 3. 

\subsection{Inverting and Adjusting Combined Capacity}

We then invert the value in R5 using the MVN instruction, and store the result in R6. This operation inverts all the bits in the value of R5. Next, we add the immediate value 4 to R6, and store the result in R7. This step essentially adds 1 to the inverted value of R5, and then adds 3 more. This allows us to check if the combined capacity of nodes A and B is greater than or equal to the threshold value of 3.

\subsection{Checking Validity of Combined Capacity}

We perform an AND operation on the values in R7 and R2, and store the result in R8. The AND operation is used to check whether the combined capacity of nodes A and B is greater than or equal to the threshold value of 3. If the result is equal to the value in R2 (3), then the combined capacity is a valid solution; if the result is equal to the value in R3 (0), then the combined capacity is not a valid solution.

\subsection{Updating the ZERO Flag}

Finally, we perform a TST operation on the values in R8 and R2. This operation updates the ZERO PSR flag based on the comparison of the values in R8 and R2. If the values are equal, the ZERO flag is set to 1, indicating that the capacities of nodes A and B form a valid solution to the Node Capacitated Cut problem. If the values are not equal, the ZERO flag is set to 0, indicating that the capacities of nodes A and B do not form a valid solution.

\section{Algorithm Efficiency}

Our algorithm is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. The algorithm does not use any loops or branches, and consists of a series of linear steps, resulting in a time complexity of $O(1)$. Additionally, we use a limited number of registers and do not rely on any memory operations or external data structures, leading to a space complexity of $O(1)$. This makes our algorithm well-suited for systems with limited computational resources, such as embedded systems or low-power devices.
