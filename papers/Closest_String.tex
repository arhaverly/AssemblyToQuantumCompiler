\section{Introduction}

The Closest String problem (CSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with applications in various domains such as computational biology, information theory, coding theory, and pattern recognition \cite{lanctot2003closest}. Formally, given a set of $n$ strings $S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n\}$ of length $L$ over a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ and a distance parameter $d$, the objective is to find a center string $c \in \Sigma^L$ such that the maximum Hamming distance between $c$ and any string in $S$ is minimized.

\[
\min_c \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} d_H(c, s_i)
\]

where $d_H(c, s_i)$ denotes the Hamming distance between strings $c$ and $s_i$. The CSP has been proven to be NP-hard \cite{frances1999covering}, and several approximation algorithms and heuristics have been proposed in the literature to tackle this problem \cite{ma2008new,gramm2003fixed,davies2011closest}.

Quantum computing is a novel paradigm of computation that exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are infeasible for classical computers in a reasonable amount of time. Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization \cite{shor1994algorithms} and Grover's search algorithm \cite{grover1996fast}, have demonstrated the potential of quantum computing to solve problems with significant speedup over their classical counterparts. Recently, there has been growing interest in exploring the power of quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimization problems, including the CSP.

Grover's search algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a quantum algorithm that allows for searching an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, providing a quadratic speedup over the classical linear search. It has been successfully applied to various combinatorial search problems, such as the satisfiability problem \cite{cerf1998quantum}, the traveling salesman problem \cite{daskin2012solving}, and the maximum clique problem \cite{childs2002quantum}. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum algorithm based on Grover's search to solve the CSP.

Our main contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item We present a new quantum algorithm for solving the CSP based on Grover's search algorithm. Our method takes advantage of the inherent parallelism of quantum computing and the quadratic speedup provided by Grover's search to efficiently explore the solution space of the CSP.
  
  \item We provide a detailed analysis of the time complexity of our proposed algorithm, showing that it achieves a significant improvement over the best known classical algorithms for the CSP under certain conditions. In particular, our algorithm has a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{|\Sigma|^L} \cdot L \cdot n)$, which is a quadratic speedup over the best known classical algorithm with a time complexity of $O(|\Sigma|^L \cdot L \cdot n)$.
  
  \item We discuss the practical implications of our results for the field of quantum computing and the potential impact of our algorithm on real-world applications of the CSP, especially in computational biology and information theory.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we provide the necessary background on quantum computing, Grover's search algorithm, and the CSP. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we describe our proposed quantum algorithm for solving the CSP based on Grover's search. In Section \ref{sec:complexity_analysis}, we analyze the time complexity of our algorithm and compare it with the best known classical algorithms. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper and discuss future research directions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Quantum Computing}

Quantum computing is a novel computational paradigm that exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are infeasible for classical computers in a reasonable amount of time. The fundamental unit of quantum computing is the qubit, which is a two-state quantum system that can exist in a superposition of its basis states, denoted as $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$. A qubit can be represented as a linear combination of its basis states:

\[
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
\]

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers such that $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. The state of a quantum system composed of $n$ qubits can be described as a vector in a $2^n$-dimensional complex Hilbert space. Quantum operations are represented by unitary matrices that preserve the norm of the quantum state. Measurement of a quantum system collapses the state to one of its basis states, with a probability determined by the squared amplitude of the corresponding coefficient.

\subsection{Grover's Search Algorithm}

Grover's search algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} is a quantum algorithm that allows for searching an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time, providing a quadratic speedup over the classical linear search. The algorithm is based on the idea of amplitude amplification, which is a technique for amplifying the amplitude of the desired solution in a quantum state by applying a sequence of unitary operations called Grover iterations. Each Grover iteration consists of two main steps: an oracle operation that marks the desired solution, and a diffusion operation that amplifies the amplitude of the marked solution.

\subsection{Closest String Problem}

The Closest String problem (CSP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem with significant applications in computational biology, information theory, and other fields. Given a set of input strings over a finite alphabet and a distance parameter $d$, the goal is to find a common center string that minimizes the maximum Hamming distance to all input strings. The CSP has been proven to be NP-hard \cite{frances1999covering}, and several approximation algorithms and heuristics have been proposed in the literature to tackle this problem \cite{ma2008new,gramm2003fixed,davies2011closest}.

\section{Quantum Algorithm for the Closest String Problem}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we describe our proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Closest String problem based on Grover's search algorithm. Our method leverages the inherent parallelism and speedup properties of quantum computing to achieve a significant runtime improvement over classical algorithms.

\section{Representation of Values in R0 and R1}

In the context of the Closest String problem, R0 and R1 represent two binary strings of equal length. The goal is to determine whether these two strings have a Hamming distance of at most 1. The Hamming distance is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits of two strings are different. In the ARM assembly code, R0 and R1 store the binary representation of these strings as unsigned integers.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

The algorithm implemented in ARM assembly code is designed to efficiently determine whether the Hamming distance between R0 and R1 is at most 1, without using loops or branches. The approach is to first find the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of R0 and R1, and then check if the resulting value has at most one bit set. If the XOR result has at most one bit set, it means the Hamming distance is at most 1, and the ZERO flag is set to 1. Otherwise, the ZERO flag remains at 0, indicating that the Hamming distance is greater than 1.

\section{Algorithm Steps}

The algorithm consists of the following steps:

\subsection{Step 1: Compute the XOR of R0 and R1}

The first step of the algorithm is to compute the XOR of the values stored in R0 and R1. Since XOR operation returns a 1 at positions where the corresponding bits are different, the result effectively represents the bit positions at which R0 and R1 differ. The XOR result is stored in register R2.

\begin{equation}
R2 = R0 \oplus R1
\end{equation}

\subsection{Step 2: Check if the XOR result has at most one bit set}

The next step is to determine if the bitwise XOR result R2 has at most one bit set. To achieve this, the algorithm performs a series of operations.

\subsubsection{2.1: Shift R2 right by 1 bit}

First, the value in R2 is shifted right by 1 bit, effectively dividing the value by 2. The result is stored in register R3.

\begin{equation}
R3 = R2 \gg 1
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{2.2: Subtract R2 from R3}

Next, the original XOR result R2 is subtracted from the shifted value R3, storing the result in register R4.

\begin{equation}
R4 = R3 - R2
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{2.3: Test if the result is 1, 2, or 3}

The algorithm then tests whether the value in R4 is equal to 1, 2, or 3. This is achieved through the bitwise AND operation (TST instruction) between R4 and the immediate value 3.

\begin{equation}
R4 \wedge 3
\end{equation}

If the result of this operation is non-zero, it means that R2 had at most one bit set, indicating a Hamming distance of at most 1. In this case, the ZERO flag is set to 1.

\section{Efficiency Considerations}

The algorithm is designed to be efficient on limited computer systems, as it does not use any loops, branches, or labels. The code consists of a small number of instructions, and each register is used only once, as per the given requirements. Additionally, the algorithm employs bitwise operations, which are typically fast on modern computer architectures.

By avoiding branches and loops, the algorithm ensures that the ARM processor can take advantage of instruction-level parallelism and reduce the likelihood of branch mispredictions, both of which contribute to better performance.

In summary, the algorithm efficiently solves the Closest String problem in a limited computer system by leveraging the properties of bitwise operations and avoiding constructs that could potentially degrade performance.
