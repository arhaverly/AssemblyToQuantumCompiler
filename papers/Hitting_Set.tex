\section{Introduction}
The Hitting Set problem is a classical combinatorial problem, defined as follows: Given a family of sets $\mathcal{F} = \{S_1, S_2, \dots, S_m\}$ over a universe $U = \{u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n\}$, find a minimum cardinality subset $H \subseteq U$ such that $H$ intersects every set in $\mathcal{F}$. The Hitting Set problem is known to be NP-hard, and it has been extensively studied due to its numerous applications in diverse areas, including data mining \cite{datamining}, computational biology \cite{compbio}, and network design \cite{network}.

Classical algorithms for solving the Hitting Set problem are based on various techniques such as integer linear programming, greedy heuristics, and local search \cite{classical}. However, these methods suffer from high computational complexity, which may render them infeasible for large-scale instances. In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative for tackling computationally hard problems. Quantum algorithms exploit the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to achieve significant speedups over classical algorithms. In this context, Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover} is a well-known quantum search algorithm that enables finding an element in an unsorted database of size $N$ with $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ queries, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving the Hitting Set problem, based on Grover's Algorithm. Our approach leverages the inherent parallelism of quantum computing to explore the solution space efficiently and utilizes amplitude amplification techniques to boost the probability of finding the optimal solution. We provide a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's correctness and efficiency, demonstrating that our method achieves a significant speedup over classical algorithms for the Hitting Set problem.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:preliminaries}, we provide an overview of the relevant background on quantum computing and Grover's Algorithm. Section \ref{sec:algorithm} presents our quantum algorithm for the Hitting Set problem, along with a detailed description of the main components and their implementation. In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, we analyze the correctness and efficiency of our algorithm, comparing its performance to classical approaches. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper and discuss future research directions.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}
In this section, we briefly review the essential concepts of quantum computing and Grover's Algorithm, which form the foundation of our method.

\subsection{Quantum Computing}
Quantum computing is a computational paradigm that exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. The basic unit of quantum information is the quantum bit or qubit, which can exist in a superposition of the basis states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$. A quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ can be represented as a linear combination of the basis states:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1},
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers such that $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. Quantum operations are represented by unitary matrices, which preserve the norm of the state vector. A quantum algorithm typically consists of a sequence of quantum gates applied to an initial state, followed by a measurement to obtain the final classical output.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}
Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that allows finding a marked element in an unsorted database of size $N$ with a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$. The algorithm can be summarized in three main steps:

1. Prepare an equal superposition of all possible states:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \ket{x}.
\end{equation}

2. Repeat the following two operations for $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ iterations:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Apply an oracle $O$ that marks the target element by adding a phase of $-1$ to its amplitude.
  \item Apply the Grover diffusion operator $G$ to amplify the amplitude of the marked element.
\end{enumerate}

3. Measure the final state to obtain the marked element with high probability.

The core of the algorithm lies in the oracle and the Grover diffusion operator, which together perform amplitude amplification, boosting the probability of finding the target element in the superposition of states.

\section{Hitting Set Problem Representation}

In the context of the Hitting Set problem, we consider R0 and R1 to represent two sets, A and B, comprised of elements from a finite universe. The elements in each set are represented using a binary format, with each bit corresponding to a unique element in the universe. For the given example, the largest element in the universe is 3, hence, each set can be represented using a 3-bit binary number.

\subsection{Binary Representation of Sets}

For both R0 and R1, the binary representation of the sets can be interpreted as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The least significant bit (LSB) represents the presence or absence of the element 1 in the set.
    \item The second least significant bit represents the presence or absence of the element 2 in the set.
    \item The third least significant bit represents the presence or absence of the element 3 in the set.
\end{itemize}

For example, if set A has elements 1 and 3, and set B has elements 2 and 3, the binary representation for R0 (set A) would be 101, and for R1 (set B) would be 011.

\section{Algorithm}

The algorithm to determine if the given sets A and B (represented by R0 and R1) form a valid solution to the Hitting Set problem is as follows:

\subsection{Union of Sets}

The first step is to obtain the union of sets A and B. This can be done using the bitwise OR operation, which is performed by the ORR instruction in ARM assembly. The result of the union is stored in register R2.

\begin{equation}
    R2 = R0 \, | \, R1
\end{equation}

\subsection{Comparison with Target Set}

After obtaining the union of sets A and B, the algorithm checks if this union contains all the elements from the finite universe, which in this case are elements 1, 2, and 3. The binary representation of the complete set containing all the elements would be 111 (7 in decimal). The CMP instruction is used to compare the value in R2 with the decimal value 7.

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

The ZERO PSR flag is used to indicate whether the union of sets A and B forms a valid solution to the Hitting Set problem or not. If the union contains all the elements from the finite universe, the ZERO flag is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.

To set the flag, the algorithm uses the SUB instruction to subtract 7 from the value in R2 and stores the result in register R3. If the union of the sets is equal to 111 (7 in decimal), the result in R3 will be 0, and the ZERO flag will be set.

\begin{equation}
    R3 = R2 - 7
\end{equation}

Finally, the TEQ instruction is used to test R3 against 0. If R3 is 0, it means the union of the sets is equal to 111 (7 in decimal), and the ZERO flag will be set to 1, indicating a valid solution to the Hitting Set problem. If R3 is not 0, the ZERO flag will remain 0, indicating an invalid solution.

\section{Summary}

The algorithm uses the binary representation of two sets, A and B, and determines if their union forms a valid solution to the Hitting Set problem. The algorithm leverages ARM assembly instructions, including ORR, CMP, SUB, and TEQ, to perform the union, comparison, and flag setting operations. The ZERO PSR flag is used to indicate the validity of the solution, with 1 indicating a valid solution and 0 indicating an invalid solution. This approach provides an efficient and concise method for solving the Hitting Set problem using ARM assembly code with the given constraints.
