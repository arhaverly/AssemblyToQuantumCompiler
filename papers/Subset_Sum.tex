\section{Introduction}
The Subset Sum problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that belongs to the NP-complete complexity class \cite{GareyJohnson}. The problem can be formally defined as follows: given a finite set $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$ of positive integers and a target sum $T$, is there a subset $S'\subseteq S$ such that the sum of its elements is equal to $T$? The Subset Sum problem has numerous applications in cryptography, coding theory, and combinatorial optimization, and thus finding efficient algorithms to solve it is of paramount importance.

Classical algorithms for solving the Subset Sum problem include exhaustive search, dynamic programming, and backtracking, among others \cite{HorowitzSahni, Bellman, CarraghanPardalos}. However, these methods have exponential time complexity in the worst case, which limits their practical applicability to relatively small problem instances. Quantum computing provides a promising alternative to classical computing, as it has the potential to significantly speed up the solution process for several computational problems, including the Subset Sum problem.

Grover's Algorithm \cite{Grover} is a quantum search algorithm that can be used to find a specific element in an unsorted database of $N$ elements with a time complexity of $O\left(\sqrt{N}\right)$. This is a quadratic speedup compared to the best possible classical algorithm for searching an unsorted database, which has a time complexity of $O(N)$. Grover's Algorithm has been widely studied and adapted to solve various combinatorial problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Graph Coloring Problem, and the Maximum Clique Problem \cite{DurrHoyer,ShenviKempeWhaley,ChildsKimmelKothari}.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the Subset Sum problem using Grover's Algorithm by mapping the problem onto a quantum search problem. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the quantum algorithm's efficiency and correctness, and show that our proposed algorithm can solve the Subset Sum problem in $O\left(2^{n/2}\right)$ time, where $n$ is the number of elements in the input set $S$. This represents a significant improvement over the classical algorithms and highlights the potential advantages of quantum computing in tackling computationally challenging problems.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:preliminaries}, we provide a brief overview of the necessary background on quantum computing and Grover's Algorithm. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present our proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Subset Sum problem and provide a step-by-step description of the procedure. In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, we analyze the efficiency and correctness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its quadratic speedup compared to classical methods. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude the paper and discuss possible future research directions.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}
In this section, we briefly review the necessary background on quantum computing and Grover's Algorithm. Quantum computing is a computational paradigm that relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. Quantum bits, or qubits, are the fundamental units of quantum information and can exist in a superposition of states, allowing quantum computers to perform certain tasks more efficiently than classical computers.

Grover's Algorithm, proposed by Lov Grover in 1996, is a quantum search algorithm that can be used to find a specific element in an unsorted database of $N$ elements with a time complexity of $O\left(\sqrt{N}\right)$. The key idea behind the algorithm is the use of amplitude amplification, a technique that increases the probability amplitude of the desired element while decreasing the amplitude of the other elements. This is achieved through a sequence of Grover iterations, each of which consists of two main operations: the oracle operation and the diffusion operation. The oracle operation marks the desired element by applying a phase shift to its amplitude, while the diffusion operation amplifies the amplitude of the marked element. After approximately $\sqrt{N}$ iterations, the desired element can be found with high probability.

\section{Values Representation in R0 and R1}

The values stored in R0 and R1 represent the target sum that we want to achieve using a subset of the given set of numbers. In the context of the Subset Sum problem, we have a finite set of integers and the goal is to determine if there exists a non-empty subset whose sum equals the target sum. In this specific example, the given set of numbers is $\{1, 2, 3\}$ and the target sum can be any combination of the values stored in R0 and R1.

\section{Algorithm Overview}

The provided ARM assembly code offers an efficient and loop-free solution to the Subset Sum problem for the given set of numbers $\{1, 2, 3\}$. The algorithm consists of three main steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initializing the registers with subset sums.
    \item Comparing the target sum (R0 + R1) with the precomputed subset sums.
    \item Setting the ZERO PSR flag based on the comparison results.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Registers Initialization}

In this step, the algorithm initializes the registers with the subset sums of the given set of numbers. Since the largest allowed number in the example is 3, we have the following subsets and their sums: $\{\}$, $\{1\}$, $\{2\}$, and $\{3\}$ with sums $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ respectively. The registers R2, R3, and R4 are initialized with these subset sums:

\begin{itemize}
    \item R2 = 1 (Subset $\{1\}$)
    \item R3 = 2 (Subset $\{2\}$)
    \item R4 = 3 (Subset $\{3\}$)
\end{itemize}

\section{Target Sum Comparison}

Once the registers are initialized, the algorithm proceeds to compare the target sum with the precomputed subset sums. To do this, the values in R0 and R1 are added together and stored in register R5. Then, the algorithm compares R5 with the subset sums using the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare R5 with 0 to check if the sum equals 0 (empty subset).
    \item Use the EOR (Exclusive OR) instruction to XOR R5 with the subset sums stored in registers R2, R3, and R4. For each comparison, the result is 0 if R5 matches the subset sum, and non-zero otherwise.
    \item Store the comparison results in registers R6, R7, and R8.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}

After comparing the target sum with the subset sums, the algorithm determines if a valid solution to the Subset Sum problem exists by performing the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform an AND operation on the results stored in registers R6 and R7, and store the result in register R9.
    \item Perform an AND operation on the results stored in registers R8 and R9, and store the result in register R10.
    \item Use the RSB (Reverse Subtract) instruction to subtract register R10 from 1, and store the result in register R11. If R10 is zero (indicating a match found), R11 will contain the value 1, else 0.
    \item Use the TST (Test) instruction to set the ZERO PSR flag if R11 contains 1, indicating that a valid solution to the Subset Sum problem exists.
\end{enumerate}

This efficient and loop-free ARM assembly implementation of the Subset Sum problem adheres to the strict requirements of register usage and instruction set constraints. By employing simple arithmetic and bitwise operations, the algorithm effectively determines if a valid solution exists for the given set of numbers and target sum stored in registers R0 and R1.
