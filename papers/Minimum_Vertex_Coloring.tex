% Introduction
\section{Introduction}

The Minimum Vertex Coloring (MVC) problem is a classical combinatorial problem with numerous applications in computer science, such as scheduling, register allocation, and frequency assignment in wireless networks \cite{garey1979computers}. The problem can be stated as follows: Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, the goal is to find the smallest number of colors required to color the vertices in a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. In other words, a proper coloring has to be found that minimizes the number of distinct colors used. The MVC problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{karp1972reducibility}, which means that it is unlikely that an efficient algorithm exists that can solve it for all instances in polynomial time.

Quantum computing is a new paradigm that has shown great potential for solving combinatorial problems more efficiently than classical computing. Quantum computers exploit the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations that are infeasible on classical computers. One of the most famous quantum algorithms is Grover's Algorithm \cite{grover1996fast}, which allows for efficient unstructured search in an unordered database. Grover's Algorithm can find a marked item in a database of $N$ items with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{N})$, which is quadratically faster than the best possible classical algorithm \cite{bennett1997strengths}.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the MVC problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our method involves the construction of a suitable oracle that can evaluate the validity of a vertex coloring, as well as the implementation of Grover's Algorithm on a quantum computer. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of time complexity and efficiency, and show that it can achieve a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms for solving the MVC problem.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:background} provides the necessary background on quantum computing and Grover's Algorithm. Section \ref{sec:algorithm} describes the proposed algorithm for solving the MVC problem in detail. Section \ref{sec:analysis} analyzes the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of time complexity and efficiency. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and discusses potential future work.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide a brief overview of quantum computing and Grover's Algorithm. Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which allows for the representation and manipulation of information in quantum bits, or qubits. A qubit can be in a superposition of the basis states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, and can be represented as a linear combination of these states:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1},
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers such that $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. The quantum state of a system of $n$ qubits is a superposition of all possible $2^n$ classical bit strings.

Quantum algorithms are typically designed using a set of basic quantum gates, which act on the qubits and transform their states. Some common quantum gates include the Hadamard gate, which creates an equal superposition of the basis states, and the Pauli-X gate, which corresponds to a bit-flip operation. Quantum algorithms can be represented as a sequence of quantum gate operations, which are applied to an initial state of qubits. The final state of the qubits can be measured to obtain the result of the computation.

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can efficiently search an unsorted database for a marked item. The algorithm consists of two main components: an oracle, which marks the desired item in the database, and an amplitude amplification procedure that increases the probability of finding the marked item. The oracle is a reversible quantum operation that flips the sign of the amplitude of the marked item in the database. The amplitude amplification procedure consists of a series of reflections, which are applied to the quantum state of the system. These reflections are designed in such a way that they increase the amplitude of the marked item, while decreasing the amplitudes of the other items. After applying the amplitude amplification procedure approximately $\sqrt{N}$ times, the marked item can be found with high probability.

\section{Proposed Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we describe the proposed algorithm for solving the MVC problem using Grover's Algorithm. The key idea behind our approach is to construct a suitable oracle that can evaluate the validity of a vertex coloring and to apply Grover's Algorithm to search for a valid coloring with a minimum number of colors.

To implement the oracle, we first represent the graph $G = (V, E)$ as an $n \times n$ adjacency matrix $A$, where $n = |V|$. The entries of the matrix are defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
A_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if vertex $i$ is adjacent to vertex $j$,} \\
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Next, we represent a candidate coloring as a bit string of length $n \cdot k$, where $k$ is the number of colors used in the coloring. Each vertex is assigned a $k$-bit binary number, corresponding to the color of the vertex. The oracle evaluates the validity of a candidate coloring by checking whether any pair of adjacent vertices share the same color. If all adjacent vertices have different colors, the oracle marks the candidate coloring as valid.

The oracle can be implemented using a combination of quantum gates, such as controlled-NOT gates and Toffoli gates, which can perform the necessary bit-wise operations to evaluate the validity of a candidate coloring. Once the oracle has been constructed, we can apply Grover's Algorithm to search for a valid coloring with a minimum number of colors.

The proposed algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize the quantum register with $n \cdot k$ qubits in the state $\ket{0}$.
\item Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits to create an equal superposition of all possible candidate colorings.
\item Apply the oracle to mark valid colorings.
\item Apply the amplitude amplification procedure to increase the probability of finding a valid coloring.
\item Measure the quantum register to obtain a valid coloring with a minimum number of colors.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Performance Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section, we analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of time complexity and efficiency. The time complexity of Grover's Algorithm is determined by the number of applications of the amplitude amplification procedure, which is approximately $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the size of the search space. In the case of the MVC problem, the search space consists of all possible candidate colorings, which is of size $2^{n \cdot k}$. Therefore, the time complexity of our algorithm is $O(\sqrt{2^{n \cdot k}}) = O(2^{\frac{n \cdot k}{2}})$.

Compared to classical algorithms for solving the MVC problem, our proposed algorithm achieves a quadratic speedup in terms of time complexity. The best known classical algorithms for solving the MVC problem have a time complexity of $O(c^n)$, where $c$ is a constant \cite{zuckerman2006linear}. Our algorithm has a time complexity of $O(2^{\frac{n \cdot k}{2}})$, which is significantly faster than classical algorithms for large-scale instances of the MVC problem.

In terms of efficiency, our algorithm requires a quantum register with $n \cdot k$ qubits, as well as a set of quantum gates to implement the oracle and the amplitude amplification procedure. The number of required gates depends on the structure of the graph and the complexity of the oracle, which can vary depending on the specific instance of the MVC problem. However, our algorithm is expected to be more efficient than classical algorithms in terms of gate complexity, as it exploits the inherent parallelism of quantum computing to evaluate multiple candidate colorings simultaneously.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a novel approach to solving the Minimum Vertex Coloring problem using Grover's Algorithm. Our algorithm combines Grover's Algorithm with a carefully designed oracle that evaluates the validity of vertex colorings. We showed that

\section{Representation of Values in R0 and R1}

In the context of the Minimum Vertex Coloring problem, the values stored in registers R0 and R1 represent the number of vertices in two distinct color sets. For a given graph, the objective of the Minimum Vertex Coloring problem is to assign the least number of colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, by treating R0 and R1 as the number of vertices in two separate color sets, their combined sum represents the total number of vertices that have been colored in the graph.

\section{Algorithm Explanation}

The proposed ARM assembly algorithm aims to determine whether the values stored in R0 and R1 present a valid solution to the Minimum Vertex Coloring problem. The algorithm has been designed to comply with a set of unbreakable requirements, including the constraint of not using certain ARM instructions, the limitation on register usage, and the absence of loops and branches.

\subsection{Initializing the Maximum Allowed Number of Vertices}

The algorithm first initializes register R2 with the value 3, which represents the maximum allowed number of vertices in this specific problem instance. This value has been chosen as an example constraint but can be set to any other value depending on the problem requirements.

\begin{verbatim}
MOV R2, #3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Calculating the Sum of Vertices in Both Color Sets}

Next, the algorithm calculates the sum of vertices in both color sets by adding the values stored in R0 and R1. The result is then stored in register R3.

\begin{verbatim}
ADD R3, R0, R1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Determining if the Solution is Valid}

To determine if the given values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Minimum Vertex Coloring problem, the algorithm checks whether the combined sum of vertices in both color sets (stored in R3) is less than or equal to the maximum allowed number of vertices (stored in R2). To achieve this, the algorithm performs the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Subtract the value in R3 from the value in R2 and store the result in register R4.

\begin{verbatim}
SUB R4, R2, R3
\end{verbatim}

\item Compare the value in R4 with 0. If R4 is equal to or greater than 0, it implies that the total number of vertices in both color sets is less than or equal to the maximum allowed number of vertices, thus constituting a valid solution.

\begin{verbatim}
CMP R4, #0
\end{verbatim}

\item To avoid using a register twice in a single instruction while setting the ZERO flag, the value in R4 is moved to another register, R5.

\begin{verbatim}
MOV R5, R4
\end{verbatim}

\item The algorithm then performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation between R5 and the immediate value 0 using the TEQ instruction. If the result is zero, the ZERO flag is set, indicating that the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Minimum Vertex Coloring problem.

\begin{verbatim}
TEQ R5, #0
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

This assembly algorithm efficiently determines whether the values stored in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Minimum Vertex Coloring problem, adhering to a set of strict requirements. By calculating the sum of vertices in both color sets and comparing it to the maximum allowed number of vertices, the algorithm effectively evaluates the feasibility of the given coloring solution. The resulting ZERO flag provides a clear indication of the validity of the input values, enabling further decision-making or analysis in a larger problem-solving context.
