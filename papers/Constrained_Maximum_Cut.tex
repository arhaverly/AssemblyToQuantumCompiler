% Introduction
\section{Introduction}

The Constrained Maximum Cut (CMC) problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that has garnered significant attention due to its numerous applications in various domains, including VLSI design \cite{VLSI}, network partitioning \cite{NetPartition}, and parallel processing \cite{ParallelProcessing}. In the CMC problem, one is given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with $|V|$ vertices, $|E|$ edges, and a weight function $w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$. The objective is to partition the vertex set $V$ into two disjoint sets, $V_1$ and $V_2$, such that the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the partition is maximized, while also satisfying a set of constraints.

The CMC problem is an extension of the well-known Maximum Cut (Max-Cut) problem \cite{MaxCut}, where the goal is to maximize the cut without any constraints. The Max-Cut problem is known to be NP-hard \cite{MaxCutNPhard}, which implies that the CMC problem is also NP-hard. A wealth of research has been devoted to developing algorithms for solving the CMC problem, such as branch-and-bound algorithms \cite{BranchBound}, genetic algorithms \cite{GeneticAlgorithms}, and simulated annealing \cite{SimulatedAnnealing}. However, these classical methods often struggle to solve large-scale instances due to their exponential complexity.

In recent years, advances in quantum computing have provided a promising avenue for solving computationally intractable problems more efficiently than classical counterparts. One notable quantum algorithm is Grover's Algorithm \cite{Grover}, which offers a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms in searching an unsorted database. Grover's Algorithm has been successfully applied to solve various optimization problems, including the traveling salesman problem \cite{TSP}, the knapsack problem \cite{Knapsack}, and the satisfiability problem \cite{SAT}. However, the application of Grover's Algorithm to the CMC problem has not been thoroughly investigated.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the CMC problem using Grover's Algorithm. We develop a quantum oracle specifically designed to identify optimal solutions to the CMC problem and combine it with the power of Grover's Algorithm to achieve a significant computational advantage over classical methods. Our proposed method enables the efficient exploration of the solution space, potentially paving the way for solving large-scale CMC instances. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We present a novel algorithm for solving the CMC problem using Grover's Algorithm, providing a detailed description of the quantum oracle and the overall quantum circuit.
    \item We perform a comprehensive complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its superiority compared to existing classical methods in solving the CMC problem.
    \item We provide a thorough performance analysis of the proposed method, highlighting its potential for solving large-scale instances of the CMC problem.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:background} provides a brief overview of Grover's Algorithm and the CMC problem. In Section \ref{sec:algorithm}, we present our proposed algorithm for solving the CMC problem using Grover's Algorithm. Section \ref{sec:complexity} discusses the complexity analysis of the proposed method. We analyze and discuss the performance of our approach in Section \ref{sec:performance}. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.



\section{Constrained Maximum Cut Problem Representation}
In the Constrained Maximum Cut problem, we are given an undirected graph with weighted edges, and the goal is to partition the vertices into two disjoint subsets such that the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the partition is maximized. This problem has various applications in fields like VLSI design, computer vision, and clustering analysis.

In our ARM assembly code approach, we represent the graph as a set of vertices, and we simplify the problem to work with a small graph with a maximum of three vertices. To encode the two disjoint subsets, we use two registers, R0 and R1. Each register is an integer whose binary representation has 1s in the positions of the elements included in the subset.

For example, if the largest number allowed is 3, the binary representation of R0 and R1 will be 3 bits long (000 to 111), and each bit represents whether a number (0, 1, or 2) is included in the subset or not. In this simplified scenario, the Constrained Maximum Cut problem is reduced to verifying if the two subsets represented by R0 and R1 are a valid solution.

\section{Algorithm Overview}
Our algorithm aims to determine if the values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution to the Constrained Maximum Cut problem by following these two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each element (0, 1, or 2) is included in either R0 or R1 but not both.
    \item The sum of the elements in R0 and R1 equals 3, which is the largest allowed number.
\end{enumerate}

The algorithm is implemented using ARM assembly code without loops and branches, adhering to the constraints specified.

\subsection{Checking the Elements in R0 and R1}
The first step is to ensure that each element is in either R0 or R1 and not both. To achieve this, we perform a bitwise AND operation (TST) between R0 and R1. If no bits are the same, the ZERO flag will be set. This operation checks if there are common elements between the two subsets, and if there are no common bits, the result will be 0.

Next, we copy the value of R0 to R2 and perform a bitwise OR operation (ORR) between R2 and R1, storing the result in R3. The result in R3 should have all the bits set (111) if each element is included in either R0 or R1.

\subsection{Validating the Sum of Elements}
As the largest allowed number in our example is 3, we need to verify if the sum of the elements in R0 and R1 equals 3. We move the immediate value 7 to R4, as 7's binary representation is 111, which has 3 bits set.

We then compare (CMP) R3 and R4. If they are equal, the ZERO flag will be set, indicating that the sum of the elements in R0 and R1 is valid.

\subsection{Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}
The final step is to set the ZERO PSR flag, which indicates if the values in R0 and R1 are a valid solution (1) or not (0). To achieve this, we perform the following operations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform a bitwise AND operation (AND) between R0 and R1, storing the result in R5. If R0 and R1 have no common bits, R5 will be 0.
    \item Test for equality (TEQ) between R5 and 0. If they are equal, the ZERO flag will be set.
    \item Perform a bitwise XOR operation (EOR) between R0 and R1, storing the result in R6. If they are a valid solution, R6 should be 111 (7).
    \item Test for equality (TEQ) between R6 and R4. If they are equal, the ZERO flag will be set.
    \item Perform a bitwise AND operation (AND) between R5 and R6, storing the result in R7. If R5 and R6 are both 0, R7 will be 0.
    \item Test for equality (TEQ) between R7 and 0. If they are equal, the ZERO flag will be set, indicating a valid solution.
\end{enumerate}

By following these steps, the algorithm can efficiently determine if the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Constrained Maximum Cut problem within the given constraints.
