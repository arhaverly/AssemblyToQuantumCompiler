\section{Introduction}

The Chromatic Index problem is a fundamental problem in graph theory that has captivated the interest of researchers for decades. Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ with a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$, the Chromatic Index problem seeks to find the smallest number of colors needed to properly edge-color the graph, such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. Mathematically, the Chromatic Index of a graph $G$, denoted as $\chi'(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ for which there exists a $k$-edge-coloring of $G$. The problem has numerous applications in various domains, including scheduling, resource allocation, and frequency assignment in wireless networks.

Classically, the Chromatic Index problem is known to be NP-hard, which implies that no efficient algorithm exists for solving the problem on general graphs unless P=NP. As a result, researchers have been exploring alternative approaches, such as approximation algorithms and heuristics, to tackle the problem more efficiently. However, these methods often come with their own set of limitations and may not guarantee optimal solutions.

In recent years, the advent of quantum computing has opened new avenues for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Chromatic Index problem. Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that are fundamentally different from classical computing. Notably, quantum algorithms have demonstrated significant speedup over their classical counterparts for specific problems, such as prime factorization using Shor's algorithm and unsorted database search using Grover's algorithm.

Grover's algorithm, in particular, offers a quadratic speedup in searching an unsorted database of $N$ elements, requiring only $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries to the database, compared to the $O(N)$ queries needed classically. This significant speedup has motivated researchers to explore the application of Grover's algorithm in solving various combinatorial optimization problems.

This paper presents a novel approach to solving the Chromatic Index problem using Grover's algorithm. The key idea is to formulate the Chromatic Index problem as a search problem, where the goal is to search for a valid edge-coloring in the space of all possible edge-colorings. By leveraging the power of quantum computing and the efficiency of Grover's algorithm, the proposed approach aims to significantly improve the computational efficiency in determining the Chromatic Index for various graphs.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the Chromatic Index problem and Grover's algorithm. Section 3 presents the proposed approach to solving the Chromatic Index problem using Grover's algorithm, along with a detailed description of the algorithm. Section 4 analyzes the performance of the proposed method and compares it with existing classical approaches. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future research directions.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Chromatic Index Problem}

The Chromatic Index problem is a classical graph theory problem that has been extensively studied in the literature. Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the Chromatic Index problem seeks to find the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists a proper $k$-edge-coloring of the graph, where a proper edge-coloring assigns distinct colors to adjacent edges. The Chromatic Index, denoted as $\chi'(G)$, is an important graph invariant that has numerous applications in various domains, such as scheduling and resource allocation.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that was introduced by Lov Grover in 1996 for searching an unsorted database. The algorithm offers a quadratic speedup over classical methods, requiring only $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries to the database, compared to the $O(N)$ queries needed classically. Grover's algorithm is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and operates on a quantum register of qubits. The algorithm consists of two main components: the oracle and the Grover diffusion operator. The oracle encodes the information about the sought element in the database, while the Grover diffusion operator amplifies the probability amplitude of the sought element, allowing it to be found with high probability after a series of iterations.

\section{Proposed Approach}

In this section, we present the proposed approach to solving the Chromatic Index problem using Grover's algorithm. The main idea is to formulate the Chromatic Index problem as a search problem, where the goal is to search for a valid edge-coloring in the space of all possible edge-colorings. By leveraging the power of quantum computing and the efficiency of Grover's algorithm, the proposed approach aims to significantly improve the computational efficiency in determining the Chromatic Index for various graphs.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

To formulate the Chromatic Index problem as a search problem, we first define the search space as the set of all possible edge-colorings of the given graph $G$. Each edge-coloring can be represented as a binary string of length $m$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. Next, we define a function $f: \{0, 1\}^m \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ that maps each binary string to either 0 or 1, such that $f(x) = 1$ if and only if the edge-coloring represented by $x$ is a valid edge-coloring of the graph with $\chi'(G)$ colors. The goal is then to find an input $x$ for which $f(x) = 1$.

\subsection{Quantum Algorithm}

The proposed quantum algorithm for solving the Chromatic Index problem consists of the following steps:

1. Initialize a quantum register of $n$ qubits, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph.

2. Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits to create an equal superposition of all possible edge-colorings.

3. Iterate the following steps for $O(\sqrt{N})$ times:

  a. Apply the oracle that encodes the function $f$ to the quantum register.

  b. Apply the Grover diffusion operator to the quantum register to amplify the probability amplitudes of the valid edge-colorings.

4. Measure the quantum register to obtain a valid edge-coloring with high probability.

\section{Performance Analysis}

In this section, we analyze the performance of the proposed approach and compare it with existing classical methods for solving the Chromatic Index problem. The main advantage of the proposed approach lies in its ability to leverage the power of quantum computing and the efficiency of Grover's algorithm to search for a valid edge-coloring in the space of all possible edge-colorings with a quadratic speedup over classical methods.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we presented a novel approach to solving the Chromatic Index problem using Grover's algorithm. The proposed approach formulates the Chromatic Index problem as a search problem and leverages the power of quantum computing to significantly improve the computational efficiency in determining the Chromatic Index for various graphs. The performance analysis shows that the proposed approach offers a quadratic speedup over classical methods, demonstrating its potential for solving the Chromatic Index problem more efficiently. Future work includes extending the proposed approach to other combinatorial optimization problems and exploring the potential of other quantum algorithms for solving the Chromatic Index problem.

\section{Chromatic Index Problem Representation}

In the given problem, R0 and R1 are registers representing the number of vertices and the maximum degree of a graph, respectively. The Chromatic Index problem is a well-known problem in graph theory and combinatorics, which aims to determine the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of an undirected graph in such a way that no two adjacent edges share the same color. This property is known as proper edge coloring. The chromatic index of a graph is denoted by $\chi'(G)$.

\subsection{Graph Representation}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. In the context of the Chromatic Index problem, two vertices are considered adjacent if there exists an edge between them. The maximum degree of a graph, denoted by $\Delta(G)$, is the highest degree among all the vertices in the graph. Here, the degree of a vertex $v$ is defined as the number of edges incident to $v$.

In our representation, R0 corresponds to the number of vertices $|V|$ in the graph, while R1 corresponds to the maximum degree $\Delta(G)$.

\subsection{Chromatic Index Theorem}

A fundamental theorem in the study of the Chromatic Index problem, known as Vizing's theorem, states that for any simple undirected graph $G$,

\begin{equation}
\Delta(G) \leq \chi'(G) \leq \Delta(G) + 1
\end{equation}

This theorem implies that the chromatic index of a graph lies between its maximum degree and its maximum degree plus one. Additionally, it is known that the chromatic index of a graph is equal to its maximum degree if the graph is of even order (i.e., has an even number of vertices) and equal to the maximum degree plus one if the graph is of odd order (i.e., has an odd number of vertices).

\section{Algorithm Description}

To determine if the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution to the Chromatic Index problem, we use an ARM assembly algorithm without loops, branches, or labels. The algorithm employs a series of arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations, and stores the final result in the ZERO Program Status Register (PSR) flag. If the ZERO PSR flag is set to 1, the values in R0 and R1 are considered a valid solution, while if it is set to 0, they are not.

\subsection{Determining Even or Odd Order}

The first step in the algorithm is to determine whether the graph is of even or odd order. To do this, we perform a bitwise AND operation between the number of vertices (R0) and 1, storing the result in register R2. If the graph is of even order, R2 will be 0; otherwise, R2 will be 1.

\subsection{Computing the Chromatic Index}

Next, we add the value in R2 to the maximum degree (R1) and store the result in register R3. This yields the chromatic index ($\chi'(G)$) of the graph according to the previously mentioned property.

\subsection{Checking the Validity}

Finally, we check whether the computed chromatic index is less than or equal to the allowed maximum value of 3. To accomplish this, we subtract 3 from the value in R3 and store the result in register R4. If R4 is positive or zero, the ZERO PSR flag is set to 1, indicating a valid solution; otherwise, the flag remains 0, indicating an invalid solution. Since we are not allowed to use the same register twice in an instruction, we use an intermediate register R5 to perform the final test operation.

\section{Conclusion}

By adhering to the constraints of the ARM assembly instructions and registers, our algorithm efficiently determines the validity of the values in R0 and R1 for the Chromatic Index problem. This approach allows us to leverage the properties of the Chromatic Index problem and the capabilities of ARM processors to achieve a compact and efficient solution without the use of loops, branches, or labels.
