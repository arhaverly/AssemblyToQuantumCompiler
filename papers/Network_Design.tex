\section{Introduction}

The Network Design problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that revolves around determining the optimal configuration of connections in a network while minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency. It plays a crucial role in various domains such as transportation, logistics, and telecommunication networks. The inherent complexity of the Network Design problem makes it an NP-hard problem, which is computationally intractable for classical algorithms when the network size increases \cite{garey1979computers}.

With the advent of quantum computing, several quantum algorithms have been developed that offer significant speedup over their classical counterparts. One such algorithm is Grover's Algorithm, a quantum search algorithm that allows for searching an unsorted database quadratically faster than classical algorithms \cite{grover1996fast}. It has been extensively studied and applied to various optimization problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem \cite{zhang2006quantum}, the Maximum Clique Problem \cite{childs2007quantum}, and the Graph Coloring Problem \cite{shukla2020quantum}. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the Network Design problem using Grover's Algorithm.

\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide an overview of the Network Design problem and Grover's Algorithm, which are the building blocks for our proposed approach.

\subsection{Network Design Problem}

The Network Design problem involves designing a network that satisfies specific constraints while minimizing the total cost. It can be formally defined as a graph optimization problem, where the goal is to find a subgraph that meets the required connectivity constraints and has the minimum cost \cite{magnanti1995network}. The problem is typically represented as a graph $G(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes, and $E$ is the set of edges with associated costs. The objective is to determine the optimal set of edges $E^*$ that satisfies the constraints and minimizes the total cost.

The Network Design problem has several variations, such as the Steiner Tree problem, the Minimum Spanning Tree problem, and the Capacitated Network Design problem. These variations can be applied to different scenarios, such as designing telecommunication networks, transportation systems, and supply chain networks.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that offers a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms \cite{grover1996fast}. Given an unsorted database of $N$ items, Grover's Algorithm can find a specific item with a probability of at least $1 - \epsilon$ in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps, where $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small constant. The algorithm is based on the principle of amplitude amplification, which exploits the interference of quantum states to increase the probability amplitude of the desired item.

Grover's Algorithm consists of two main components: a quantum oracle and an amplitude amplification step. The quantum oracle encodes the information about the problem in a quantum state and marks the desired item. The amplitude amplification step increases the probability amplitude of the marked item, making it more likely to be found upon measurement. The algorithm iterates these steps to improve the probability of finding the desired item.

In the context of optimization problems, Grover's Algorithm can be used to search for the optimal solution in a significantly reduced time compared to classical search algorithms. By applying Grover's Algorithm to combinatorial optimization problems, we can leverage the quantum advantage to improve the efficiency of solving these problems.

\section{Problem Formulation}
In the Network Design problem, we are given two integer values, where $R0$ represents the number of routers, and $R1$ represents the number of switches in the network. The goal is to determine if these values form a valid solution for a given network. A valid solution is defined as one having at least one router and one switch in the network. The ARM assembly code provided in this paper verifies the validity of the given $R0$ and $R1$ values, without using loops or branches, and following the specified instructions.

\section{Algorithm Description}
The proposed algorithm works in a linear sequence, without any loop or branch structures, and adheres to the given set of allowed ARM assembly instructions. The algorithm can be divided into three main steps:

\subsection{Routers Validation}
First, the algorithm checks if the value of $R0$, which represents the number of routers, is greater than or equal to 1. This is achieved by using the \texttt{CMP} instruction to compare $R0$ with the immediate value 1. If $R0$ is greater than or equal to 1, the result of the comparison will be a non-negative number. In this case, the algorithm moves the immediate value 1 into register $R2$. If the comparison results in a negative number, the algorithm moves the immediate value 0 into register $R2$. This is achieved by using the \texttt{CMN} instruction to negate the comparison and then the \texttt{EOR} instruction to apply the exclusive OR operation between two registers, effectively storing the desired result in $R2$. 

\subsection{Switches Validation}
The algorithm proceeds to check if the value of $R1$, representing the number of switches, is greater than or equal to 1. Similar to the routers validation, the \texttt{CMP} instruction is used to compare $R1$ with the immediate value 1. If $R1$ is greater than or equal to 1, the result of the comparison will be a non-negative number. In this case, the algorithm moves the immediate value 1 into register $R3$. If the comparison results in a negative number, the algorithm moves the immediate value 0 into register $R3$. Again, the \texttt{CMN} and \texttt{EOR} instructions are used to store the desired result in $R3$.

\subsection{Combining Results and Setting the ZERO PSR Flag}
After validating the number of routers and switches separately, the algorithm combines the results stored in $R2$ and $R3$ using the \texttt{AND} operation. The result of this operation is stored in register $R5$. If both $R2$ and $R3$ contain the value 1, the \texttt{AND} operation will result in 1, indicating a valid solution. If either $R2$ or $R3$ contains the value 0, the \texttt{AND} operation will result in 0, indicating an invalid solution.

Finally, the algorithm sets the ZERO PSR flag based on the result in $R5$ by using the \texttt{TST} instruction. The ZERO PSR flag will be set to 1 if the values in $R0$ and $R1$ form a valid solution, and 0 otherwise.

\section{Algorithm Complexity and Efficiency}
The proposed algorithm has a constant time complexity, i.e., $O(1)$, as it does not contain any loop or branch structures, and works in a linear sequence. Since the algorithm follows a strict set of allowed ARM assembly instructions and avoids any loop or branch structures, it is highly efficient in terms of both time and resources. This makes the algorithm suitable for running on limited-resource devices, such as embedded systems or low-power microcontrollers.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented an efficient ARM assembly code algorithm to verify the validity of given values in the Network Design problem. The algorithm effectively checks for the presence of at least one router and one switch in the network, without using loops or branches, and adheres to a specified set of ARM assembly instructions. The constant time complexity and high efficiency of the algorithm make it suitable for running on resource-constrained devices.
