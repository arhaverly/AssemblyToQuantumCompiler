Query:

Run this assembly program and tell me what the zero PSR flag value will be:

; R0 = weight
MOV R0, 1

; R1 = bias
MOV R1, 1



; R2 = input
MOV R2, 1

; R3 = target
MOV R3, 2


MUL R4, R0, R2
ADD R5, R4, R1


; compare output to target
CMP R5, R3





GPT4's response:

To analyze the zero flag value of the PSR (Program Status Register) after executing the provided assembly program, we need to follow the program's operations step by step:

1. `MOV R0, 1` sets R0 to 1.
2. `MOV R1, 1` sets R1 to 1.
3. `MOV R2, 1` sets R2 to 1.
4. `MOV R3, 2` sets R3 to 2.
5. `MUL R4, R0, R2` multiplies R0 (1) and R2 (1), resulting in R4 being set to 1.
6. `ADD R5, R4, R1` adds R4 (1) and R1 (1), resulting in R5 being set to 2.
7. `CMP R5, R3` compares R5 (2) with R3 (2).

The `CMP` instruction sets the zero flag if the values compared are equal. Since R5 and R3 are both 2, the zero flag will be set to 1 (indicating equality).
