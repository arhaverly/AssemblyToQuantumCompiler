; Load R0 and R1 with the adjacency matrix of the example graph
MOV R0, #5 ; Example: R0 = 101 (binary)
MOV R1, #2 ; Example: R1 = 010 (binary)

; Check if the graph is a clique
TST R0, #7 ; Test if R0 has all bits set
MOV R2, R1 ; Move R1 to R2
TST R2, #3 ; Test if R2 (former R1) has all bits set
AND R3, R0, R2 ; Combine the results

; Check if the graph can be covered by two cliques
BIC R4, R0, #7 ; Invert R0
BIC R5, R1, #3 ; Invert R1
AND R6, R4, R1 ; Combine inverted R0 and R1
AND R7, R5, R0 ; Combine inverted R1 and R0
ORR R8, R6, R7 ; Combine the results

; Set the ZERO PSR flag if the graph is a valid solution
ORR R9, R3, R8 ; Combine the results
TEQ R9, #0 ; Set the ZERO PSR flag
