; R0 represents the set S = {1, 2} and R1 represents the set T = {3}
; The Set Cover problem is to find a minimum number of sets from a set of sets, such that their union covers the universal set U = {1, 2, 3}
; In this case, the values in R0 and R1 represent a valid solution if their union covers the set U

; We will use bitwise OR to find the union of the sets represented by R0 and R1
; R2 will store the result of the bitwise OR operation
ORR R2, R0, R1

; Since the largest number allowed for our example is 3, the universal set U = {1, 2, 3} can be represented as the binary value 0111 (7 in decimal)
; We will now compare the result stored in R2 with the binary value of the universal set
; If R2 == 0111, then the ZERO flag will be set to 1, indicating a valid solution, otherwise it will be set to 0

; R3 will store the immediate value 7
MOV R3, #7

; Now, we perform the comparison using CMP instruction
CMP R2, R3

; The ZERO PSR flag is now set according to the outcome of the comparison
